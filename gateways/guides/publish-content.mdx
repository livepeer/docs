This section explains how to publish and consume content to the Livepeer
Gateway.

This can be done via a command line interface using FFmpeg, or from a graphical
user interface using OBS Studio and VLC Media Player.

# Command Line Interface

This section explains how to publish content to and from Livepeer Gateway using
a command line interface (CLI).

## Install `FFmpeg`

Install `FFmpeg` for your platform following the instructions on the
[FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Run the following command to send an RTMP test stream to the Gateway:

```
ffmpeg -re -f lavfi -i \
       testsrc=size=1280x720:rate=30,format=yuv420p \
       -f lavfi -i sine -c:v libx264 -b:v 3000k \
       -x264-params keyint=60 -c:a aac -f flv \
       rtmp://<YOUR IP ADDRESS>:1935/test_source
```

- `test_source` is the "stream key" for this publication.
- `size=1280x720` defines the dimensions of the test video source in pixels
- `rate=30` defines the frame rate of the test video in frames per second
- `1000k` defines the bitrate for the stream
- `keyint=60` defines the keyframe interval in frames

## Run the following command to send a recorded video file to the Gateway:

```
ffmpeg \
        -re \
        -i video.mov \
        -codec copy \
        -f flv rtmp://<YOUR IP ADDRESS>:1935/video_file
```

- `video_file` is the "stream key" for this stream.

# Graphical User Interface

This section explains how to publish media to the Livepeer Gateway using a
graphical user interface (GUI).

## Publish content using OBS Studio

OBS Studio can be used to publish streaming media to the Livepeer Gateway:

Download and install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

In the **Stream** section of OBS Studio enter the following:

```
Service: Custom
Server: rtmp://<YOUR IP ADDRESS>:1935
Stream Key: stream-key
```

In the main window choose **Start Streaming**
