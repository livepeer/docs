## Download and unzip the Livepeer binary

```
https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

```

## Create a bat file to launch Livepeer.

Use the following as a template, adding your personal info and save a .bat file
in the same directory as the Livepeer executable.

```
livepeer.exe -network=arbitrum-one-mainnet -ethUrl=<YOUR ARB RPC> -cliAddr=127.0.0.1:5935 -serviceAddr=<YOUR GATEWAY PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>:8935 -broadcaster -maxPricePerUnit=300 -pricePerUnit=1 -monitor=true -v=6 -rtmpAddr=0.0.0.0:1935 -httpAddr=0.0.0.0:8935 -blockPollingInterval=20

PAUSE
```

## Start the Livepeer Gateway

Start the Livepeer Gateway using the .bat file.

When prompted enter and confirm a password.

<Warning>
  This password is used to decrypt the keystore file and access the private key.
  Make sure to never share or lose access to either the password or the keystore
  file
</Warning>

After confirming your password close the terminal.

## Create a file containing your Gateway Ethereum password

In `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.lpData` create a txt file named `ethsecret.txt`
with the password you created in the previous step.

## Add the `-ethPassword` flag to your .bat file

Add `-ethPassword=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.lpData\ethsecret.txt` to the
previously created .bat file

_If you'd like the Gateway to start with Windows you can create a System service
using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) or the Windows Task Scheduler._

Open the Livepeer CLI, then Jump to
[Configure Transcoding Options](/gateways/guides/transcoding-options) to finish
configuring the Gateway

```
livepeer_cli.exe -host 127.0.0.1 -http 5935
```
