<Note>
  The Livepeer Gateway was previously called the Livepeer Broadcaster so you
  will see some commands and labels still use the Broadcaster name that haven't
  been updated in the code.

## Prerequisites

Working knowledge of system adminsitration tasks for your target platform are
required. This guide provides directions for Linux, Windows, and Docker
platforms. Familiarity with Livepeer protocol is beneficial. For more
information view the go Livepeer
[installation guide.](/orchestrators/guides/install-go-livepeer)

This guide was developed using:

- Ubuntu Linux 22.04
- Docker 20.10.14
- Windows
- Livepeer 0.7.2
- root user access (sudo is ok)

Have access to an Arbitrum RPC URL. This is required to run Livepeer. Popular
services include [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and
[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Be aware that these services have their own
pricing plans. That being said, the latest versions of livepeer should be able
to stay within the request limit for these provider's free tier at least for a
single node. As an alternative, you can self-host your own Arbitrum node, see
the
[instructions from Offchain Labs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node).
