 *Note the Livepeer Gateway was previously called the Livepeer Broadcaster so you will see some commands and labels still use the Broadcaster name that haven't been updated in the code.*

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are familiar with installing software on unix-based
systems. You should be comfortable with command-line syntax, Networking,
Firewalls, and containerized environments. You should have a basic understanding
of the Livepeer protocol. You dont have to be an expert, but troubleshooting
skills will come in handy.  For more information view the go Livepeer [installation guide.](//orchestrators/guides/install-go-livepeer)



This guide was developed using:

- Ubuntu Linux 22.04
- Docker 20.10.14
- Windows
- Livepeer 0.7.2
- root user access (sudo is ok)

Have access to an Arbitrum RPC URL. This is required to run Livepeer. 
Popular services include [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and 
[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Be aware that these services have their
own pricing plans. That being said, the latest versions of livepeer should be able
to stay within the request limit for these provider's free tier at least for a single 
node. As an alternative, you can self-host your own Arbitrum node, see the 
[instructions from Offchain Labs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node).
