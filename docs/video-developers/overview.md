# Video Developer Overview

This section of the documentation is for developers who want to integrate the
public network's live video transcoding service into an application or video
workflow. There are many
[use cases](/video-developers/core-concepts/use-cases) for Livepeer and the
community is excited to see what you build. If you get stuck introduce yourself
in the [#broadcasting](https://discord.gg/8Vr6B2qERb) Discord channel and the
community will be happy to assist.

## A note about Self-Sovereignty

These docs are intended to help you build _directly on Livepeerâ€™s Public Network_,
and help you maintain full operational independence, as a self-sovereign entity.
Proceeding on this path will provide you with full autonomy, without lock-in to
any centralised or permissioned entity.

They are intended to get you started quickly, and will provide you with a
fully-observable end-to-end video stack, and will present you with the full set of
functionality provided by Livepeer's open-source video software.

They do not require you to incur any costs while developing and testing, or while
operating with low volume in production. They do not require you to provide any
personal identification such as username, email address or financial details, or
to create any account with any centralised provider of infrastructure services.

If you prefer to forego this self-sovereignty, and rely on a centrally-hosted
service, providing a subset of available functionality, using centralised
authentication, and traditional payment rails, check out [Livepeer.com](https://livepeer.com).
