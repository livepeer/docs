This section of the documentation is for developers who want to integrate the
public network's live video transcoding service into an application or video
workflow. There are many
[use cases](/video-developers/core-concepts/use-cases) for Livepeer and the
community is excited to see what you build. If you get stuck introduce yourself
in the [#broadcasting](https://discord.gg/8Vr6B2qERb) Discord channel and the
community will be happy to assist.

> Note: These docs are geared towards developers interested in building services
> and applications using the open and permissionless Livepeer public network
> directly. This requires self-hosting client software and managing your own
> crypto wallet for payments. If you prefer a serverless hosted service with API
> access to the Livepeer network and traditional payment rails check out
> [Livepeer.com](https://livepeer.com).
