# Choosing a Role

As a video miner, you can take on the role of an orchestrator or transcoder. A
full description of the roles and responsibilities can be found
[here](/video-miners/core-concepts/roles-and-responsibilities).

You may want to consider running an orchestrator if you are:

- Interested in earning LPT rewards
- Interested in participating in governance with your staked LPT
- Interested in scaling up your operation over time to maximize the amount of
  work received (instead of sharing work received by another orchestrator as a
  transcoder)
- Able to maintain a static IP or DNS name for broadcasters to access
- Comfortable with maintaining a publicly accessible server on the Internet
- Comfortable with managing and securing Ethereum private keys
- Comfortable with managing and spending ETH to pay for transactions to redeem
  payments and distribute rewards

You may want to consider running a transcoder if you are:

- Interested in getting started with transcoding ASAP
- Interested in minimizing the amount of dev ops work that you have to do
- Comfortable with receiving a smaller share of work on the network because you
  will be sharing the work received by another orchestrator
- Comfortable with not earnings LPT rewards because the compensation structure
  of transcoding pools will vary and they may only payout ETH fees

If you want to run a transcoder, see the
[transcoding pools](/video-miners/core-concepts/pools) section for
information on pools that are live on the network today.

If you want to run an orchestrator, continue with the next part of this section.
