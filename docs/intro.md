# Welcome to Livepeer!

The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which is cheaper to an app developer than using traditional centralized live video solutions.

This site is organized by topics including concepts, tasks, and reference information designed for the following Livepeer [network roles](/protocol/core-concepts/network-roles):

- [Orchestrators](/video-miners/)
- [Developers](/developers)
- [Delegators](/delegators)

### What's new

**[Livepeer Network Upgrade](https://medium.com/livepeer-blog/the-confluence-upgrade-is-live-3b6b342ea71e)** - Livepeer now offers faster transactions and lower costs for broadcasters, orchestrators, and delegators.

**[How to Migrate your Orchestrator to Arbitrum](/video-miners/guides/l2-migration)** - Instructions for One-time Migration to Arbitrum (L2)

**[Latest Releases](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases)** - We strongly encourage all node operators to upgrade to >=0.5.28 by February 21 so you can connect to Arbitrum Mainnet after the LIP-73 block.
