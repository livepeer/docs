# Welcome to Livepeer!

The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which is cheaper to an app developer than using traditional centralized live video solutions. 

This site is organized by topics including concepts, tasks, and reference information designed for [Orchestrators](/livepeer-quick-start/video-mining-quick-start/choosing-a-role.md) on the Livepeer Network including:

- [Video Miners](/video-miners/core-concepts/roles-and-responsibilities#types-of-video-miners), including [Transcoders](/video-miners/core-concepts/roles-and-responsibilities#types-of-video-miners)
- [Video Developers](/video-developers/overview)

**Note** [Delegators](/protocol/core-concepts/ecosystem-participants#delegator) can also benefit from content on this site, with some information included for you as well.
