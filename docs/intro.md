# Welcome to Livepeer!

The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which is cheaper to an app developer than using traditional centralized live video solutions. 

This site is organized by topics including concepts, tasks, and reference information designed for [participants](/protocol/core-concepts/ecosystem-participants) on the Livepeer Network:

- [Video Miners](/video-miners/core-concepts/roles-and-responsibilities#types-of-video-miners)
- [Video Developers](/video-developers/)
- [Delegators and Tokenholders](/protocol/core-concepts/ecosystem-participants#delegator)

### What's new

**[Livepeer Network Upgrade](https://medium.com/livepeer-blog/the-confluence-upgrade-is-live-3b6b342ea71e)** - Livepeer now offers faster transactions and lower costs for Livepeer broadcasters, orchestrators, and delegators.

**[How to Migrate your Orchestrator to Arbitrum](https://docs.livepeer.org/video-miners/how-to-guides/l2-migration)**  - Instructions for One-time Migration to Arbitrum (L2)

**[Latest Releases](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases)** - We strongly encourage all node operators to upgrade to >=0.5.28 by February 21 so you can connect to Arbitrum Mainnet after the LIP-73 block.
