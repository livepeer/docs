## Making quick edits to existing documents

Quick edits streamline the process to report and fix small errors and omissions in documents. While you can create issues to report mistakes, it's faster and easier to create a pull request (PR) to fix the issue, when the option is available.

Most docs pages allow you to edit content directly in the browser. If so, you'll see an Edit button like the one shown below. Clicking the Edit (or equivalently localized) button takes you to the source file on GitHub.

Please note that the in-browser editing experience is best for minor or infrequent changes. If you make large contributions or use advanced Git features (such as branch management or advanced merge conflict resolution), you need to fork the repo and work locally.


### Edit Link

If the page is editable, you'll see a link to edit at the bottom of the page. This will take you to the Github text editor for that page. If the Edit button isn't present, it means the content isn't open to public contributions. Some pages may be  generated (for example, from inline documentation in code) and must be edited in the project they belong to.

### Editing on Github

Once you're in Github, select the pencil icon to edit the article. If the pencil icon is grayed out, you need to either log in to your GitHub account or create a new account.

Once you've launched the web editor, make your changes. You can click the Preview changes tab to check the formatting of your change.

Once you have made your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page. Enter a title and description for your changes and click Propose file change as shown in the following figure:

![change](/docs-assets/contributing/propose-changes.png)

Now that you've proposed your changes, you need to ask the Livepeer core contributors to "pull" your changes into the repo. This is done using something called a "pull request". When you select Propose file change, a new page similar to the following is displayed:

![compare](/docs-assets/contributing/compare.png)

Select Create pull request, enter a title, and optionally a description for the pull request, and then select Create pull request. If you are new to GitHub, see About Pull Requests for more information.

That's it! Core contributors will review and merge your PR when it's approved. You may get feedback requesting changes.


## Reviewing open PRs
You can see proposed updates or new articles before they are published by checking open PRs in public repositories. Review them and add your comments. Community feedback on potential changes helps the entire community.

You can find all open PRs [here](https://github.com/livepeer/docs/pulls).

## Creating quality issues
Our docs are a work in progress. Good issues help us focus our efforts on the highest priorities for the community. The more detail you can provide, the more helpful the issue. Tell us what information you're looking for, how you searched for it, and where you got stuck.

Issues start the conversation about what's needed. Core contributors will respond to these issues with ideas for what we can add, and ask for your opinions. When we create a draft, we'll ask you to review the PR.

You can create issues [here](https://github.com/livepeer/docs/issues).
