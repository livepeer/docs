Welcome to the Livepeer Documentation
========================================

`Livepeer`_ is a decentralized video streaming network build on the Ethereum blockchain. Livepeer is for:

.. _Livepeer: http://livepeer.org

- Developers who want to build applications that include live video.
- Tokenholders who want to help improve and secure the network by acquiring and staking LPT.
- Node operators who want to transcode video in exchange for ETH and LPT rewards.

Use this documentation to learn how to:

- Broadcast video on the network.
- Participate as an orchestrator, transcoder or delegator.
- Build applications with live video features.
