Welcome to the Livepeer Documentation
========================================

`Livepeer`_ is a decentralized video broadcasting platform powered by
a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain. Livepeer is for:

.. _Livepeer: http://livepeer.org

- Developers who want to build applications that include live video.

- Users who want to stream video, gaming, coding, entertainment, educational courses, and other types of content..

- Broadcasters who currently have large audiences and high streaming bills or infrastructure costs can use the Livepeer network to potentially reduce costs or infrastructure overhead.

Use this documentation to learn how to broadcast video through
Livepeer, participate in the Livepeer protocol as a transcoder or
delegator, and build apps or DApps with video based features using
Livepeer.

We suggest you start with :doc:`getting_started`. If you are interested in testing out Livepeer without setting up your own nodes, sign up for `early access`_ to the pilots program.
