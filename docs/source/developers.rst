Developing on Livepeer
======================

Building Video Dapps
---------------------
* Video-based Dapps (for example, `livepeer.tv`_)
* Infrastructure tools and services for broadcasters or live streamers (for example, SAAS services on top of Livepeer)
* Livepeer Player - A react component for playing live video - https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/tree/master/packages/chroma

.. _livepeer.tv: http://livepeer.tv

Building Livepeer Protocol Dapps
--------------------------------
* Dapps for the Livepeer ecosystem. (for example, `livepeer protocol explorer`_ or `Supermax`_)

.. _livepeer protocol explorer: https://explorer.livepeer.org/
.. _Supermax: https://www.supermax.cool/livepeer

Building Tools for Livepeer
---------------------------
* SDKs for Livepeer (for example, `livepeerjs-sdk`_ or `livepeerjs-graphql`_)
* Client implementation for Livepeer (for example, `go-livepeer`_)

.. _livepeerjs-sdk: https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/tree/master/packages/sdk
.. _livepeerjs-graphql: https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/tree/master/packages/graphql-sdk
.. _go-livepeer: https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer

Open Projects
------------------

Livepeer also posts open problems for discussion, ideas, and collaboration on Github. Check out:

* `Open Project Proposals`_
* `Open Research Areas`_

Contributing to Livepeer
--------------------------

For developers who are looking for interesting to problems to work on related to decentralized tech, blockchain, cryptocurrency, video engineering, and peer-to-peer networking, Livepeer may provide some interesting challenges. The three technical areas that Livepeer focuses on today are:

* Protocol implementation (Smart Contract)
* Livepeer Node (Distributed Systems / Networking)
* Livepeer Media Server (Video Engineering)

For the protocol , you can follow the `protocol repo`_. It requires some background in `Solidity`_ and the `Livepeer Whitepaper`_.

For the livepeer node, check out the `go-livepeer repo`_. It requires some understanding of Golang and `Geth`_.

For the livepeer media server implementation, take a look at the `LPMS repo`_. It requires some video engineering knowledge. The `demuxed conf videos`_ and the `Apple Live streaming doc`_ are good resources to start learning.

If you're interested in the any of the above challenges, or are building video features into an application, jump into our `development chat room on Discord`_ and join the conversation.
