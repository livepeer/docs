Transcoding
***********

Transcoding can be performed using either a software based encoder/decoder on a CPU or using a hardware encoder/decoder on a GPU.

GPU transcoding is generally significantly faster than CPU transcoding. In the past, the video quality from GPU transcoding was substantially 
worse than the video quality from CPU transcoding, but the gap in video quality has been closed in recent years with newer GPU models. See 
this `page <https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/GPU-SUPPORT.md>`_ for a list of GPUs that have been tested and are known to be supported by Livepeer software.
