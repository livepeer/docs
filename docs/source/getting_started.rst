Getting Started
=====================

This guide will get you started with broadcasting your first video using the Livepeer tools in 5 minutes. Livepeer is currently under active development, and it is accessed through the command line on OS X or Linux.

The first step in getting started with Livepeer is to try to run the Livepeer executables and to broadcast a simple video. 

.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
---------------

Livepeer has a dependency on a pre-compiled version of `ffmpeg`_. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/livepeer/ffmpeg-static.  You should add the appropriate version to your PATH to make sure it can be invoked by the Livepeer binary.

.. _ffmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org

.. _install:

Install Livepeer
-----------------

Download ``livepeer`` and ``livepeer_cli`` from https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases. Choose the _darwin version for OS X and the _linux versions for Linux, and then untar them::

    $ tar -xvf livepeer_darwin.tar
    $ mv ./livepeer_darwin/livepeer ./livepeer
    $ mv ./livepeer_darwin/livepeer_cli ./livepeer_cli
    $ ./livepeer -bootnode -offchain

This will start a Livepeer node.

.. _broadcast:

Broadcast a video
------------------------

In another terminal window::

    $ ./livepeer_cli
    
Select Broadcast a video. This will print out a manifestID, and you are now streaming live from your laptop's web cam::
  
  Current RTMP setting: http://localhost:1935/streams
  Current HTTP setting: http://localhost:8935/streams
  Keep it? (Y/n) >
  Now broadcasting -
  ManifestID: 1220cad22d9509e03e61e9995f912f348aa3ccb4bc07a5325fe14a4c1dd4bd2cffa3f1841bda0921035bd431636bbc0daac03ae3ea1a3005bec9dc93974af98019a4
  Type `q` to stop broadcasting



.. _stream:

Play the stream
---------------------

- Copy the manifestID.
- Visit http://media.livepeer.org/player.html in your browser.
- Paste the manifestID and press play.

You should now see your stream. Anyone else on your own private Livepeer test network should also be able to see your stream. 

.. _whatsnext:

What's Next?
----------------------

You just demonstrated sending video around the P2P network in ``--offchain`` mode. Time to go on chain to utilize the Livepeer network's true power, and learn how to use more convenient tools to broadcast and consume the streams. The next sections will teach you how to run a node on the blockchain, use Livepeer to broadcast to a large audience, how to build an app with video functionality using Livepeer, and how to participate in the Livepeer protocol as a delegator or transcoder.
