# Livepeer Media Server

The Livepeer Media Server is an open source media server that is capable of
taking input streams of live video and audio and transcoding them into alternate
encodings, transrating it into different bitrates, and transmuxing it into
different delivery formats. This is necessary so that a video, recorded in one
format and bitrate, can now reach every screen on every device on every
platform, each of which may have their own requirements about format and
bandwidth restrictions.

There is no shortage of media server solutions on the market, however most are
proprietary, developed and sold by a single company, are not open source, and
come with high costs or licensing fees. The open source solutions are limited,
and are typically incomplete, out of date, lack support, or require you to
upgrade to proprietary service packages in order to receive the full set of
features.

Since the Livepeer Media Server is a core component of an economically efficient
protocol and network, its development is financed by the protocol itself. This
allows it to be fully open source and transparent, and as a result benefits from
community in the form of peer review, open discussion around features requests
and bugs, and community driven contribution.

The media server can be used as a standalone component in any media streaming
application that anyone wishes to build using it, however it is truly powerful
as a tool that is running within the Livepeer Network.
