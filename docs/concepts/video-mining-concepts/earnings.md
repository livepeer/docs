# Earnings

Orchestrators are compensated for video transcoding services with rewards
denominated in LPT and fees denominated in ETH.

Note that transcoders participating in
[pools](/video-mining-concepts/core-concepts/pools) are compensated based on the
rules of the particular pool.

## Rewards

An orchestrator earns rewards based on its total stake (includes its own
self-delegated stake and the stake of its delegators) which accrue every day.
These rewards are analogous to the block reward in PoW blockchains such as
Bitcoin.

Ways to earn more rewards include:

- Staking more LPT
- Attracting stake delegation from delegators by:
  - Performing well on the leaderboard at https://explorer.livepeer.org/
  - Performing well in the network and earning fees from broadcasters
  - Setting commission rates to share rewards and fees with delegators

## Fees

An orchestrator earns fees based on the video transcoding service it provides to
broadcasters. The more transcoding that an orchestrator performs, the more fees
it will earn. These fees are analogous to the transaction fees in PoW
blockchains such as Bitcoin.

Ways to earn more fees include:

- Staking more LPT or attracting stake delegation in order to provide more
  economic security to broadcasters
- Minimizing latency by ensuring access to hardware and bandwidth resources, and
  expanding geographic coverage

## Costs

Costs incurred while operating on the network include:

- Ethereum transaction fees
- Hardware costs
- Bandwidth costs
- Electricity costs
