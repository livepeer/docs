This section of the documentation is for developers who want to integrate the public network's live video transcoding service into an application or video workflow. 

## Examples
The community is excited to see what you build. For examples of what Livepeer developers can create, *See...*

If you get stuck, introduce yourself
in the [#broadcasting](https://discord.gg/8Vr6B2qERb) Discord channel and the
community will be happy to assist.

**Note** These docs are geared towards developers interested in building services and applications using the open and permissionless Livepeer public network directly. **This requires self-hosting client software and managing your own crypto wallet for payments.** 

**Note** If you prefer a serverless hosted service with API access to the Livepeer network and traditional payment rails,  check out [Livepeer.com](https://livepeer.com).
