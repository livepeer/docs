# Video Development

The getting started tutorial will walk you through the steps required to send a
livestream into the Livepeer public network for transcoding and play it back
inside your application.

> Note: for the sake of this guide, we'll be livestreaming using the Rinkeby
> test network. You can think of this network like a sandbox environment for
> testing your livestreams. If you're livestreaming in a production setting make
> sure to change the network to `mainnet`. Learn more about supported networks,
> including Ethereum mainnet and Rinkeby,
> [here](/installation/connect-to-ethereum#supported-networks).

## Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have `livepeer` [installed](/installation/install-livepeer/overview)
- Make sure you have access to an
  [Ethereum JSON-RPC URL](/installation/connect-to-ethereum)
