# Create a Livestream

Livepeer supports livestreaming using the RTMP protocol, which is supported by
most broadcast software/hardware as well as open source software for mobile
applications.

For this guide, we recommend [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download). Once you
have it downloaded and installed follow these steps to start livestreaming:

1. Navigate to Settings -> Stream
2. Enter the RTMP Server URL provided by your broadcaster node
   (`rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935`)
3. At the bottom of the window is a box called 'Sources'. Click on the + (or
   right click inside the box) and pick the source you want. As a few examples,
   select Game Capture if you're capturing a game, Window for non-game
   applications, or Video Capture Device for a webcam or capture card.
4. Double check that all your settings are how you want them in Settings ->
   Output. Then, just hit Start Streaming.
