## About Markdown

All of Livepeer's documentation is written in Markdown, a simple markup language that allows us to easily format documents. Although there are distinct implementations of Markdown (e.g. CommonMark, Multimarkdown), Livepeer documentation follows [Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (*See* [Getting Started writing on github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)).
