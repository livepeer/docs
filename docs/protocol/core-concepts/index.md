# Overview

The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol
that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and
results in a solution which is cheaper to an app developer than using
traditional centralized live video solutions. In this section we present the
core components of the Livepeer protocol and describe their role in creating a
cryptoeconomically secure platform for live video broadcast.
