# Video Miner Overview

This section of the livepeer.org documentation is for **video miners**. Video
miners in the Livepeer network provide video transcoding services.

Orchestrators are nodes running on the Livepeer network
bitrates that need to be transcoded in realtime on the network

[Video Miners](/video-miners/core-concepts/roles-and-responsibilities) include those running a node to provide transcoding services
Transcoders transcode video
[Paid in Arbitrum (L2)]

Become a transcoder:
speed on internet
location matters - are you located where there is a demand for transcoding (e.g. Europe, USA)

Understand how much transcoding can be done with your GPU using some tools available to you [Tools](https://livepeer.academy/tools/) provided by contributors of our community allow you to understand:

- LPT token (see what you can earn with a calculator)
- benchmarking
-
