This guide provides steps to walk you through the process of running an orchestrator on the Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet. New and existing orchestrators can test an implementation in a no-risk environment before continuing on the Arbitrum mainnet: 

- To ensure that your orchestrator is correctly configured, and 
- To take any [troubleshooting](/video-miners/guides/troubleshooting) steps and test any modifications you make to your settings. 

> **Note:** If you are new to Livepeer be sure to read [Quickstart guide](/video-miners/getting-started/getting-started.md) before proceeding.

### Run on Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet

1. Acquire Rinkeby ETH 

Rinkeby ETH are free test ethers used for transaction fees to run on the network. You can get Rinkeby ETH from a faucet so that you can bridge it to Arbitrum, i.e. transfer your Rinkeby ETH from the faucet to the Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet. Most faucets provide ~0.1 ETH per request, but you may use them multiple times if you need more.

> **Note:** You can use an existing third-party faucet to acquire ETH.  We recommend [the official Rinkeby faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet) (requires Twitter or Facebook auth), or [the Chainlink faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) (no auth required). 

Once you've acquired the Rinkeby ETH, use the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io) to send Rinkeby ETH to the Arbitrum blockchain. After bridging, you will want to send the Arbitrum Rinkeby ETH to the wallet that you may be using to run your orchestrator.

2. Get an Arbitrum Rinkeby RPC url

We recommend using [the Offchain Labs public testnet endpoint](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet). Alternatively, you can [set up an Arbitrum node](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node) or acquire an Arbitrum RPC url using a third-party service like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/). 

> **Note:** When using a third-party service, be sure to select the option to connect to Arbitrum Rinkeby and follow the instructions to obtain the URL and any required keys.
<br></br>

3. Run the `livepeer_cli` to point to Arbitrum Rinkeby

> **Note:** If you have not already installed Livepeer, please refer to [this guide](https://livepeer.org/docs/installation/install-livepeer/) before running the command below.

```bash
$: livepeer \
    -network arbitrum-one-rinkeby
    -ethUrl https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc # RPC Url for Arbitrum Rinkeby provider, acquired in Step 2 above
		-orchestrator
```

> **Note:** If you are running on the same machine as your mainnet Orchestrator, you may encounter an error. 

> For example: 

> You are expecting chainID of 1, but got 4. 
 you change networks without changing the network name or datadir. 

 > This indicates your testnet setup is trying to access the same `.lpData` that it used for the mainnet, and it is finding a conflict on `chainId`. To address this, specify a new data directory using the `-datadir` flag when you start your Orchestrator. Be sure to specify only the directory, not the file.
<br></br>

4. Run  `livepeer-cli` to acquire Arbitrum Rinkeby LPT so that you can stake on the network and activate your orchestrator.

This transaction will send you 10 Rinkeby LPT.  

- Run `livepeer-cli`, 
- select “`Get test LPT`” from the list of options. 

 > **Note:** that **if you do not have any Arbitrum Rinkeby ETH in your wallet, this transaction will fail.**

<br></br>

5. Bond your Arbitrum Rinkeby LPT and start an orchestrator.

Once you’ve received Arbitrum Rinkeby LPT, 

- select “`Invoke multistep` `become an orchestrator`”. 
- Follow the prompts to start your Orchestrator.

> **Note:** If this is your first time starting an Orchestrator, please refer to [the activation guide](/video-miners/getting-started/activation) before proceeding.

<br></br>
6. Check your network connection

```bash
curl localhost:7935/EthChainID 
```
If you are correctly connected to Arbitrum Rinkeby, this command will return `421611`.

> **Note:** If you are running `livepeer_cli`with Docker, you will need to check port `7935` inside the go-livepeer container.

<br></br>

7. Register your service URI and fee structure 

To receive work, you must register your service URI and fees so that broadcasters can discover your orchestrator. You need to [acquire Arbitrum Rinkeby ETH](/video-miners/getting-started/testnet#run-on-arbitrum-rinkeby-testnet).

- Use the `livepeer_cli` on Arbitrum
- Select option `13: Set orchestrator config`

```bash
$: livepeer \
    -network arbitrum-one-mainnet
    -ethUrl https://arbitrum.io/rpc # RPC Url for Arbitrum, 
        -orchestrator
```
