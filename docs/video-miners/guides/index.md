# Introduction

The following are guides that provide information and instruction about how you can learn more about Livepeer and how to work with an Orchestrator.

### [Connect an orchestrator with separate transcoders](/video-miners/guides/o-t-split) 

The split orchestrator and transcoder architecture allows the orchestrator to outsource transcoding to remote transcoders run by the same orchestrator or  third parties.

### [Benchmark Transcoding](/video-miners/guides/benchmarking)
=======
- [Set transcoding session limits](/video-miners/guides/session-limits): Manage transcoding capacity to maximize work received while also protecting against performance degradation due to overload.

How to configure and run the `livepeer_bench` to test the capacity to process livestream segments.

### [Set transcoding session limits](/video-miners/how-to-guides/session-limits)

Manage transcoding capacity to maximize work received while also protecting against performance degradation due to overload.

### [Setup orchestrator and transcoder metrics monitoring](/video-miners/guides/metrics-monitoring)

Configure Livepeer, to enabling metrics monitoring for your orchestrator and transcoder(s).

### [Dual mine](/video-miners/how-to-guides/dual-mining)

Configure an orchestrator to transcode video on GPUs while concurrently mining cryptocurrencies and performing other CUDA operations such as machine learning.

### [Set pricing](/video-miners/how-to-guides/pricing) 

Orchestrators set and configure pricing to charge for transcoding which is advertised to broadcasters off-chain.

### [Vote](/video-miners/how-to-guides/vote)

Orchestrators can use `livepeer_cli` to vote in governance polls without exporting their keys from the machine that their orchestrator node is running on.

### [Troubleshooting](/video-miners/how-to-guides/troubleshooting)

Notes on troubleshooting advice for video miners and lists some of the most common issues that a video miner might encounter.
