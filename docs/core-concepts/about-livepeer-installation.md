The following covers information to keep in mind as you go through the steps of an installation.

It is based on the following video tutorial [How to set up a Livepeer Orchestrator](https://youtu.be/-gfSkX5xL-U) from the [Livepeer Academy](https://livepeer.academy/video-tutorials/)

**Note** This tutorial is for a Windows machine, from which you should be able to glean the information needed for your implementation.


### Requirements

Before you perform an installation, it is important to understand and be able to address the following requirements for your implementation. 

- Nvidia GPU (the only brand of GPU that works on the Livepeer network)
If you have IRIS, as is common with new Windows machines, or for your preference, `livepeer` does accomodate running  with your CPU but this is not recommended)
- Calculating your [bandwith](/video-mining-references/reference-information/bandwidth)
- Internet Bandwidth -- 120 mbs
- Static IP -- `Livepeer` will work with a dynamic IP address. However, when receiving streams for broadcasters you will want a static IP to make sure it goes to the same location each time.
- Required LPT - Livepeer token is required 
- There are 100 available slots. In order to see where you can fit in, go to the livepeer explorer to see how 
- Ethereum to cover gas fees - (Also ***See*** LPT2 migration information )
- Network Knowledge -- Understanding static and dynamic IP addresses, firewalls is necessary as you change configurations during set-up and troubleshooting
