First, go to [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio), if you haven't already,
and create an account. Once you've created an account, you'll be able to create
an API key by clicking on the "Create API Key" button on Developers page.

<Warning>
  We do not recommend using ["CORS-enabled" API
  keys](/api-reference/overview/authentication) - they will be deprecated in an
  upcoming release. We recommend making requests from your backend to the
  Livepeer Studio API.
</Warning>

</Frame>

You can now use this API key in Livepeer SDKs and APIs in order to authenticate
your requests and start building.

<Info>
  We recommend creating separate accounts for your development and production
  environments. This will allow you to easily isolate your environments. We will
  be shipping a solution for multi-environment management soon.
</Info>

In this example, we will use Javascript and React to upload a video. Make sure
to setup a React app first.

## Install the JS SDK and Livepeer React

We install both the NodeJS SDK (which works in all JS environments with `fetch`)
and the Livepeer React library, which provides composable React primitives for
building video apps.

```
npm install livepeer @livepeer/react
```

## Set up the SDK

Add a API key to the environment variables, and construct a new Livepeer SDK
client.

```tsx
import Livepeer from "livepeer";

const livepeer = new Livepeer({
  apiKey: process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
});
```

## Retrieve playback info

We can now use the SDK on the backend to fetch the playback info for our asset.

This asset was uploaded using the dashboard, but this can also be an asset
created from an application.

```ts
import { getSrc } from "@livepeer/react/external";

const playbackId = "f5eese9wwl88k4g8";

export const getPlaybackSource = () => {
  const playbackInfo = await livepeer.playback.get(playbackId);

  const src = getSrc(playbackInfo.playbackInfo);

  return src;
};
```

## Play the asset

We can now use Player component from the SDK to play a video. In the below
example, we style the elements with Tailwind, but you can use any styling
solution:

```tsx
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon } from "@livepeer/react/assets";
import { getSrc } from "@livepeer/react/external";
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";
import { vodSource } from "./source";

export const DemoPlayer = ({ src }: { src: Src[] | null }) => {
  return (
    <Player.Root src={src}>
      <Player.Container>
        <Player.Video title="Live stream" />

        <Player.Controls className="flex items-center justify-center">
          <Player.PlayPauseTrigger className="w-10 h-10">
            <Player.PlayingIndicator asChild matcher={false}>
              <PlayIcon />
            </Player.PlayingIndicator>
            <Player.PlayingIndicator asChild>
              <PauseIcon />
            </Player.PlayingIndicator>
          </Player.PlayPauseTrigger>
        </Player.Controls>
      </Player.Container>
    </Player.Root>
  );
};
```

## Start building

Check out the [SDKs](/sdks/introduction) and
[API Reference](/api-reference/overview/introduction) pages to learn more about
how to use the SDKs and API to build your application.

You can also refer to the [Guides](/developers/guides/overview) section for more
in-depth tutorials on how to use the SDKs and API to build specific
applications.
