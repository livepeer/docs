  "Learn how to token gate videos using Livepeer and Lit: A step-by-step
  tutorial"
---

Token gating is a method of restricting access to videos based on ownership of a
specific type of token or cryptocurrency. It can be used to restrict access to
certain videos to those who hold a specific type of token, such as an NFT
(non-fungible token). One of the primary benefits of token gating is that it
allows creators to monetise their content more effectively. It can also provide
creators with more control over their content and its distribution. By
restricting access to certain videos to those who hold a specific token,
creators can ensure that their content is only being viewed by those who have a
genuine interest in it.

Lit Protocol is a decentralised key management network powered by threshold
cryptography. A blockchain-agnostic middleware layer, Lit can be used to read
and write data between blockchains and off-chain platforms, powering conditional
decryption and programmatic signing.

When combined with Livepeer, developers can build token-gated video applications
and allow creators to token-gate their video with specific tokens, NFTs,
addresses, etc. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a token-gated
video application with Lit and Livepeer.

Here is a high-level workflow diagram of how Livepeer’s access control feature
works and how we will use it in our app:

<Frame>![VoD Workflow](/images/tutorials/vod-diagram.png)</Frame>
## Prerequisites

Before you start with this tutorial, make sure you have the following tool
installed on your machine:

- Latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version
- An Ethereum wallet such as Metamask or Rainbow

In addition to the above tools, this tutorial assumes that you have a basic
understanding of Next.js

## Setting up Next.js App

First, create a directory for the project and then initialize a Next.js app
using the following command in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app .
```

This will create a new Next.js app in the current directory and install all the
necessary dependencies.

> While creating a Next.js application, you will be prompted if you would want
> to use Tailwind. In this tutorial, we will be using Tailwind, so make sure to
> set up a Next.js app with Tailwind.

Once the project is created successfully, run the following command to install a
few other dependencies.

```
npm install @livepeer/react @lit-protocol/sdk-nodejs @rainbow-me/rainbowkit ethers lit-js-sdklit-share-modal-v3 nanoid wagmi next-transpile-modules
```

## Setting up Clients

In this tutorial, we will be using different packages and SDKs which means we
have to set up the context and clients for each of them. Let’s start with
RainbowKit and WAGMI

### RainbowKit and WAGMI

For this tutorial, we will be using Rainbow Kit and WAGMI to handle
authentication such as connecting the wallet and signing message.

First, inside of `_app.js` import the following from Rainbow and WAGMI.

```js
import "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css";

import { getDefaultWallets, RainbowKitProvider } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import { configureChains, createClient, WagmiConfig } from "wagmi";
import { mainnet } from "wagmi/chains";

import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";
```

Then, configure your desired chains (in this tutorial, we will be using Ethereum
mainnet) and generate the required connectors. You will also need to set up a
WAGMI client.

```js
// ... import { alchemyProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/alchemy';
// ... import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';

const { chains, provider } = configureChains([mainnet], [publicProvider()]);
const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: "My Awesome App",
  chains,
});
const wagmiClient = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  provider,
});
```

Finally, wrap your application with `RainbowKitProvider` and `WagmiConfig`

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}>
      <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </RainbowKitProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  );
};
```

### Livepeer

Livepeer is a decentralized video infrastructure protocol that allows users to
upload, transcode, and serve video content. The Livepeer React SDK provides a
set of ready-to-use hooks that make it easy to integrate Livepeer into a
project.

To get started, navigate to
[](https://livepeer.studio/register)[https://livepeer.studio/register](https://livepeer.studio/register)
and create a new account on Livepeer Studio. This will give you access to your
Livepeer dashboard, where you can manage your account and access your API keys.

Once you have created an account, in the dashboard, click on the Developers on
the sidebar.

<Frame>
  ![Livepeer Studio - Create API key
  page](/images/tutorials/studio-create-api.png)
</Frame>

Then, click on Create API Key, give a name to your key, and then copy it as we
will need it later.

To use Livepeer React in your project, create a new directory named `client` in
the root directory, and add the following code to `index.js`

```js
import { createReactClient, studioProvider } from "@livepeer/react";

const LivepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" }),
});

export default LivepeerClient;
```

Make sure to replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key which you just copied from
the Livepeer dashboard. And also replace the code inside of `_app.js` in the
page directory with the below code.

```js
//... import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';

import { LivepeerConfig } from "@livepeer/react";
import LivepeerClient from "../client";

//... const wagmiClient = createClient({

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={LivepeerClient}>
      <WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </RainbowKitProvider>
      </WagmiConfig>
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

And that is it, you can now use Livepeer to upload and transcode assets.

### Lit Protocol

As mentioned above, we will be using Lit Protocol for token gating/access
control in our application. First, create a new directory named `hooks` and
inside of it, create a new file named `useLit`. This would be the file to handle
the connection with Lit’s node. Add the following code to it:

```js
import {
  createContext,
  FunctionComponent,
  useContext,
  useEffect,
  useMemo,
  useState,
} from "react";
import LitJsSdk from "lit-js-sdk";

const LitClientContext = createContext({
  litNodeClient: null,
  litConnected: false,
});

export const LitProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const client = useMemo(
    () => new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClient({ debug: false }),
    []
  );
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    client
      .connect()
      .then(() => {
        {
          setConnected(true);
        }
      })
      .catch(() =>
        alert(
          "Failed connecting to Lit network! Refresh the page to try again."
        )
      );
  }, [client]);

  return (
    <LitClientContext.Provider
      value={{ litNodeClient: client, litConnected: connected }}
    >
      {children}
    </LitClientContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default function useLit() {
  return useContext(LitClientContext);
}
```

Here, we have created a provider and a custom hook to manage the connection to a
Lit node client throughout the application. This is useful if you want to share
the same instance of the Lit node client across multiple components in the app.

Next, add the following lit imports to `_app.js` and also wrap the application
with `LitProvider`

```js
// import LivepeerClient from '../client';

import "lit-share-modal-v3/dist/ShareModal.css";
import { LitProvider } from "../hooks/useLit";

//... const wagmiClient = createClient({

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <LitProvider>
      <LivepeerConfig client={LivepeerClient}>
        <WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}>
          <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </RainbowKitProvider>
        </WagmiConfig>
      </LivepeerConfig>
    </LitProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Backend

The first step is to set up a background route that will handle the webhook and
verify the token. Since we are using Next.js, we can simply use the `api`
routes.

### Create a Webhook Handler

The first step is to create an access control webhook handler. We need to set up
an endpoint (e.g.,
[](https://yourdomain.com/api/check-access)[https://yourdomain.com/api/check-access](https://yourdomain.com/api/check-access))
to handle the logic for granting or denying access to your assets. This endpoint
should accept a POST request with a JSON payload containing the access key and
webhook context.

This is an example of a payload this endpoint would receive:

```js
{
  "accessKey": "your-access-key",
  "context": {
    "assetId": "abcd1234",
    "userId": "user5678"
  },
  "timestamp": 1680530722502
}

```

In the Next.js `api` directory, create a new file named `verify-lit-jwt.js` and
add the following code to it

```js
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import * as LitJsSdk from "@lit-protocol/lit-node-client-nodejs";

interface Payload {
  baseUrl: string;
  path: string;
  orgId: string;
  iat: number;
  exp: number;
}

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  const { accessKey, webhookContext } = req.body;

  const { verified, header, payload } = LitJsSdk.verifyJwt({
    jwt,
  });

  if (!verified) {
    res.status(403).json({ message: "Access token is not correct" });
  } else if (
    webhookContext?.resourceId &&
    (webhookContext.resourceId.baseUrl !== payload.baseUrl ||
      webhookContext.resourceId.path !== payload.path ||
      webhookContext.resourceId.orgId !== payload.orgId)
  ) {
    res.status(403).json({ message: "ResourceId does not match" });
  } else {
    res.status(200).json({ message: "Success" });
  }
};

export default handler;
```

The above code verifies a JWT access token and checks if its payload matches the
webhook context's resource ID. The Lit SDK is used to verify the JWT access
token, which must contain a payload object with `baseUrl`, `path`, `orgId`,
`iat`, and `exp` fields.

If the access token is not verified or if the resource ID does not match, an
HTTP response with a status code of 403 is returned. If everything is fine, the
handler returns an HTTP response with a status code of 200.

Next, deploy your Next.js app to Vercel or any other hosting provider as we will
need a link to the verify JWT API.

### Register an Access Control Webhook

Once you deployed, you can use the Livepeer Studio dashboard to create a new
webhook with the type `playback.accessControl` and specify the URL of your
access control endpoint.

<Frame>
  ![Livepeer Studio - Add Webhook
  page](/images/tutorials/studio-add-webhook.png)
</Frame>

Once created, copy the id of Webhook as we will need it later in the next step.

## Frontend

Now that we have set up the clients and backend, we can move to the front end
and add the upload and access control features to our app.

### Wallet Connection

First, we need to allow users to connect their wallets. Create a new directory
named `components` and inside of it, create a new file named `Connect` and add
the following code to it.

```js
import React from "react";
import { ConnectButton } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";

export default function Navbar() {
  return (
    <div className="absolute top-0 left-0  ml-10 mt-10 flex items-center ">
      <ConnectButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

It is a simple component that imports ConnectButton from Rainbow which would
handle the authentication.

### Upload page

In the pages directory, we can use `index.jsx` as the upload page, or you can
also create a new file named `upload.jsx` for the upload page. In this tutorial,
we will be using `index.jsx` as the upload page and it will be the index page of
our app.

First import the following in the `index.jsx` file.

```js
import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from "react";
import useLit from "../../hooks/useLit";
import { nanoid } from "nanoid";
import { useAsset, useCreateAsset } from "@livepeer/react";
import Link from "next/link";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import LitJsSdk from "lit-js-sdk";
import LitShareModal from "lit-share-modal-v3";
```

After that, we have to create a `resourceId` that will be used by Lit for
checking the access control.

```js
//... import LitShareModal from "lit-share-modal-v3";

const resourceId = {
  baseUrl: "my-awesome-app.vercel.app",
  path: `/asset/${nanoid()}`,
  orgId: "some-app",
  role: "",
  extraData: `createdAt=${Date.now()}`,
};
```

Next, add the following hooks inside the component. The code contains a few
useStates for managing the state, the lit hook which we created earlier, and
finally the `useAccount` hook that is imported from WAGMI.

```js
// Inputs
const [file, setFile] = useState(undefined);
const fileInputRef = useRef(null);

// Lit
const [showShareModal, setShowShareModal] = useState(false);
const [savedSigningConditionsId, setSavedSigningConditionsId] = useState();
const [authSig, setAuthSig] = useState({});
const { litNodeClient, litConnected } = useLit();

const [litGateParams, setLitGateParams] = useState({
  unifiedAccessControlConditions: null,
  permanent: false,
  chains: [],
  authSigTypes: [],
});

// Misc
const { address: publicKey } = useAccount();
```

Next, we need to pre-sign the user’s wallet after it is connected using Lit. To
do that, you can add the following code after the useAccount hook.

```js
//...const { address: publicKey } = useAccount();

// Step 1: pre-sign the auth message
  useEffect(() => {
    if (publicKey) {
      Promise.resolve().then(async () => {
        try {
          setAuthSig({
            ethereum: await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({
              chain: "ethereum",
              switchChain: false,
            }),
          });
        } catch (err: any) {
          alert(`Error signing auth message: ${err?.message || err}`);
        }
      });
    }
  }, [publicKey]);

```

In the above code, we are checking if the user is connected, if they are, the
app asks to sign the message and then save it to `AuthSign` state.

Next, after signing the message, we can use `useCreateAsset` to upload the video
to Livepeer. In the below code, we also specify the webhook id, which we created
earlier. And `useAsset` hook to check if the asset upload/processing is
completed

```tsx
// Step 2: Creating an asset
const {
  mutate: createAsset,
  data: createdAsset,
  status: createStatus,
  progress,
} = useCreateAsset(
  file
    ? {
        sources: [
          {
            file: file,
            name: file.name,
            playbackPolicy: {
              type: "webhook",
              webhookId: "WEBHOOK_ID",
              webhookContext: {
                accessControl: litGateParams.unifiedAccessControlConditions,
                resourceId: resourceId,
              },
            },
          },
        ] as const,
      }
    : null
);

// Step 3: Getting asset and refreshing for the status
const {
  data: asset,
  error,
  status: assetStatus,
} = useAsset({
  assetId: createdAsset?.[0].id,
  refetchInterval: (asset) =>
    asset?.storage?.status?.phase !== "ready" ? 5000 : false,
});
```

You can also add the below code to check the status of the upload.

```js
const progressFormatted = useMemo(
  () =>
    progress?.[0].phase === "failed" || createStatus === "error"
      ? "Failed to upload video."
      : progress?.[0].phase === "waiting"
      ? "Waiting"
      : progress?.[0].phase === "uploading"
      ? `Uploading: ${Math.round(progress?.[0]?.progress * 100)}%`
      : progress?.[0].phase === "processing"
      ? `Processing: ${Math.round(progress?.[0].progress * 100)}%`
      : null,
  [progress, createStatus]
);

const isLoading = useMemo(
  () =>
    createStatus === "loading" ||
    assetStatus === "loading" ||
    (asset && asset?.status?.phase !== "ready") ||
    (asset?.storage && asset?.storage?.status?.phase !== "ready"),
  [asset, assetStatus, createStatus]
);
```

Add the following code that would get called once everything is complete to save
the signing conditions on Lit.

```js
// Step 4: After an asset is created, save the signing condition
  useEffect(() => {
    if (
      createStatus === "success" &&
      asset?.id &&
      asset?.id !== savedSigningConditionsId
    ) {
      setSavedSigningConditionsId(asset?.id);
      // @ts-ignore
      const ACConditions = asset?.playbackPolicy.webhookContext.accessControl;
      console.log(ACConditions, resourceId);
      Promise.resolve().then(async () => {
        try {
          await litNodeClient.saveSigningCondition({
            unifiedAccessControlConditions: ACConditions,
            authSig,
            resourceId: resourceId,
          });
        } catch (err: any) {
          alert(`Error saving signing condition: ${err?.message || err}`);
        }
      });
    }
  }, [litNodeClient, createStatus, savedSigningConditionsId, authSig, asset]);

```

Finally, we can write a function that would call the createAsset to upload the
video.

```js
const handleClick = async () => {
  if (!publicKey) {
    console.log("Please connect your wallet to continue");
    return;
  }

  if (!file) {
    console.log("Please choose a file");
    return;
  }
  if (!litGateParams.unifiedAccessControlConditions) {
    console.log("Please choose the access control conditions");
    return;
  }
  createAsset?.();
};
```

Next, in the return function add the following JSX code. It is pretty long, but
I am going to explain it.

```js
return (
  <section className="p-10 h-screen flex flex-col lg:flex-row-reverse">

                val: LitGateParams
              ) => {
                setLitGateParams(val);
                setShowShareModal(false);
              }}
              darkMode={true}
              injectCSS={false}
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  </section>
);
```

The first section contains a banner image and some text that describes the
purpose of token gating on the Livepeer platform. Then we have two input fields.
The first input field allows the user to select a video file to upload. The
second input field allows the user to set access control conditions. Once a user
clicks on the second input, it displays a modal window that allows the user to
customize the access control conditions using the LitShareModal component.

And that is it for the upload page. Save the file and you should see a similar
page:

<Frame>

![Lit app homepage](/images/tutorials/lit-app-homepage.png)

</Frame>

### Watch Page

For this watch page, you can create a new directory named `watch` inside the
page and then create a new file named `[playbackId].tsx`. This will tell Next.js
to match any link of `/watch/anything` to this page. Next, import the following
into the page.

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import { Player, usePlaybackInfo } from "@livepeer/react";
import useLit from "../../hooks/useLit";
import LitJsSdk from "lit-js-sdk";
```

Then, add the following hooks inside of the page:

```js
// ... import LitJsSdk from "lit-js-sdk";

export default function Watch() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const playbackId = router.query.playbackId?.toString();
  const { address } = useAccount();
  const { litNodeClient, litConnected } = useLit();

  const [gatingError, setGatingError] = useState();
  const [gateState, setGateState] = useState();
  const [jwt, setJwt] = useState("");

```

Next, we would need to fetch the playback info using the playback id. We can do
this very easily using the `usePlaybackInfo` hook from `@livepeer/react`

```js
// Step 1: Fetch playback URL
const { data: playbackInfo, status: playbackInfoStatus } = usePlaybackInfo({
  playbackId,
});
```

Next, we need a function to check whether the users have access. This function
can easily be handled with Lit SDK

```js
async function checkLitGate(litNodeClient, playbackPolicy) {
  const ethSign = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({
    chain: "ethereum",
    switchChain: false,
  });
  const jwt = await litNodeClient.getSignedToken({
    unifiedAccessControlConditions: playbackPolicy.webhookContext.accessControl,
    authSig: { ethereum: ethSign },
    resourceId: playbackPolicy.webhookContext.resourceId,
  });

  console.log(jwt);
  setGateState("open");
  setJwt(jwt);
  return jwt;
}
```

And finally, we can add a `useEffect` function to get playback info and check
Lit access control when the component mounts.

```js
// Step 2: Check Lit signing condition and obtain playback cookie
useEffect(() => {
  if (playbackInfoStatus !== "success" || !playbackId) return;
  const { playbackPolicy } = playbackInfo?.meta ?? {};
  setGateState("checking");

  setTimeout(() => {
    checkLitGate(litNodeClient, playbackPolicy)
      .then(() => {
        console.log("open");
      })
      .catch((err: any) => {
        setGateState("closed");
      });
  }, 1000);
}, [address, playbackInfoStatus, playbackInfo, playbackId, litNodeClient]);
```

And that is it. We can add the following code to the return function to render
the player if the JWT is valid, otherwise show a message that the user doesn’t
have access.

```js
return (
  <>
    <div className="flex flex-col text-lg items-center justify-center mt-40">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold font-MontHeavy text-gray-100 mt-6">
        Asset Token Gating with Lit Signing Conditions
      </h1>
      <p className="text-base font-light text-gray-500 mt-2 w-1/2 text-center">
        Prove your identity to access the gated content.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="flex justify-center text-center font-matter">
      <div className="overflow-auto border border-solid border-[#00FFB250] rounded-md p-6 w-3/5 mt-20">
        {jwt && <Player playbackId={playbackId} accessKey={jwt} />}
        {gateState == "checking" && (
          <p className="text-white">Checking, please wait...</p>
        )}
        {gateState == "closed" && (
          <p className="text-white">
            Sorry, you do not have access to this content
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  </>
);
```

And that is it. Save the file. Now try uploading a video and then once it is
uploading come to the watch screen and check if you have access to it. Here is a
short video of the whole flow:

## Token gate multiple assets with the same ACL condition

If you want to token gate multiple assets with the same access control
conditions, then you can simply get unified access control conditions from the
Lit SDK and the same resources Id and then send the same info to as many assets
as would like to token gate.

The access controls conditions and resource id should be inside of the Webhook
Context.

```js
const {
    mutate: createAsset,
    data: createdAsset,
    status: createStatus,
    progress,
  } = useCreateAsset(
    file
      ? {
          sources: [
            {
              file: file,
              name: file.name,
              playbackPolicy: {
                type: "webhook",
                webhookId: "WEBHOOK_ID",
                webhookContext: {
                  accessControl: litGateParams.unifiedAccessControlConditions,
                  resourceId: resourceId,
                },
              },
            },
          ] as const,
        }
      : null
  );

```

## Remove the ACL conditions

If you want to remove the access control conditions from an asset. You need to
update both the Livepeer Studio API as well as the Lit state. However, this is
only possible, if the access control condition is not chosen permanently.
