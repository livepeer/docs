An in-browser broadcast refers to the process of transmitting live video content directly from a user's web browser to online audiences in real-time, facilitated by Livepeer's low latency WebRTC technology.
This method eliminates the need for specialized broadcasting equipment or external software such as OBS, allowing content creators to engage with their viewers effortlessly.

1. **Initialization:**
  - A stream is created through Livepeer's API.
  - A WebRTC connection is created within a web application using the stream key. [SDP negotiation using WHIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-wish-whip) creates a low-latency WebRTC connection to Livepeer's infrastructure.
    - Optionally, a developer can use the livepeer.js Broadcast component to do this automatically, given a stream key.
2. **WebRTC Broadcast:**
  - The user's webcam and microphone capture live video and audio content directly from the browser. This can also include screen capture, using browser APIs.
3. **Stream Presentation:**
  - The live video content is made accessible to viewers through an embedded iframe or player.
  - The iframe references a specific URL associated with the stream playback ID, allowing viewers to watch the broadcast.
4. **STUN/TURN Server Utilization:**
  - STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are utilized to enhance network connectivity, ensuring minimal disruptions due to firewalls or network challenges. **STUN/TURN are required for broadcasting.**

In-browser broadcasting empowers content creators to effortlessly share live video with their audiences, allowing real-time engagement and interaction directly from the browser.
