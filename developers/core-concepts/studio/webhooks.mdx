A webhook is a common way for developers to integrate real-time updates in their application by providing an endpoint which Livepeer Studio can send events to.

A webhook event refers to a specific event in Livepeer that prompts a webhook to be fired. Once an event takes place, the webhook activates, "pushing" relevant information or notifications to the application endpoint.

Webhooks can be created in Studio under the Developer/Webhooks page:
