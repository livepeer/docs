A multistream facilitates the simultaneous broadcast of a source stream, along with its transcoded renditions, to various RTMP/RTMPS destinations like Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live.
This feature ensures that users can maximize their audience reach across multiple platforms with a single streaming session.

When setting up a multistream, users have the option to either utilize [Studio](https://livepeer.studio) or directly interface with the [create multistream API](/api-reference/multistream/create). 
These offer comprehensive management tools to configure, modify, or delete specific multistream targets linked with individual streams. It's important to note that configurations are stream-specific; hence, they don't automatically transfer when generating new streams.

The essential parameters for setting up a target include a name, the ingest URL, and, if relevant, adding a stream key. Users can also specify which rendition profile they intend to dispatch to the target.

After creating a multistream target, it can be toggled as active/inactive. Also, both the dashboard and API provide options for editing or deleting these targets.
**To initiate multistreaming, the multistream target needs to be linked to a stream.**

#### Monitoring

For performance monitoring and understanding stream health, Studio offers real-time indicators through its dashboard and API, showing whether a multistream target is currently active or offline.
The status updates might experience a slight delay before the stream's live status gets mirrored on the destination platform.
In Studio's "Health" tab, users can obtain a detailed view of the ingest rate for the active source stream.

#### Webhooks

Additionally, Livepeer have three webhooks to monitor Multistream Targets:

1. `multistream.connected`: Indicates a successful connection to the Multistream Target and confirms the stream's live status on the corresponding service.
2. `multistream.error`: Flags issues during the connection process, suggesting potential configuration errors or problems with the destination platform.
3. `multistream.disconnected`: Notifies users when a stream concludes and multistreaming to a particular target has also ended.
