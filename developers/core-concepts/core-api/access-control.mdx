Livepeer supports access control on streams and assets, which lets developers restrict who can view media on their platform, depending on their application needs.
The API supports both webhook and JWT-based access control.

#### Webhook

The recommended option for application access control for applications is to use webhooks.
It has the simplest integration path, and is familiar for developers.

A user can mark a stream or asset as "gated", which means that a viewer cannot access the stream without a token.

When stream playback is attempted, Studio sends a `playback.accessControl` webhook event, and applications can register a webhook handler to respond to this event.

If the webhook responds with a `2XX` HTTP response code, Livepeer will enable playback. If it is non-2XX, playback will be rejected.
The access control check happens at the playback layer, which means that even if a user gets access to the underlying `playbackId`,
they will not be able to play the media without valid credentials.

Using this framework, a blockchain agonistic Token Gating feature can be easily implemented. Rich ACC
providers, like [Lit](https://litprotocol.com/), can be integrated using webhook access control.
