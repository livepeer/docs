A Stream represents a livestream object that can be identified, recorded, and processed within Livepeer. A stream is a video feed that is broadcast in real-time. Livepeer is responsible for the lifecycle management (CRUD) of a stream. A stream is uniquely identified by its Stream ID, and associated with a defined metadata describing its characteristics.

A stream can be created with the [Create Stream](/api-reference/stream/create) API endpoint. Once a stream is created, there are set of webhook events to notify its state transitions, including `stream.started`, `stream.idle`.

#### Recording

If recording is enabled, there are a set of webhook events which can notify your backend of a recordingâ€™s state transitions, including: `recording.ready`, `recording.started`, and `recording.waiting`. The recording is stored as an [asset](/developers/core-concepts/core-api/asset#recording).

#### Multistream

A stream can be directed to multiple stream targets, such as YouTube or Twitter, using [multistream](/developers/core-concepts/core-api/multistream).

#### Ingest

RTMP is the default ingest protocol for streaming. WebRTC and SRT ingest are also supported. See the [Stream from the browser](/developers/guides/livestream-from-browser)
guide on how to use WebRTC ingest.

When a stream is live, [stream health](/developers/core-concepts/studio/stream-health) provides a set of metrics about its performance and ingest health. This provides
tangible feedback for creators who want better livestream performance.

Also, Livepeer provides [viewership metrics](/developers/guides/get-engagement-analytics-via-api), which allow a more comprehensive look into viewer behavior using the [livepeer viewership API](/api-reference/viewership/get-viewership-metrics).
Reporting is enabled by default in the Livepeer Player, and can be integrated into any third party player.

#### Playback

A stream can be easily viewed by passing a `playbackId` to the [Livepeer Player](/developers/core-concepts/player/overview). If using a third party player, the full playback url is required. This can be fetched from the [Playback Info](/api-reference/playback/get) API endpoint.

The Livepeer Player will default to [WebRTC playback](developers/core-concepts/player/low-latency). WebRTC ensures low latency that is sub-second on source and around 2-5 seconds on transcoded renditions.
This means that (depending on stream settings) users will often have a sub-second viewing experience.

The Livepeer Player will fall back to HLS playback using HLS.js if b-frames are detected in the stream or there is a transient network error with WebRTC initiation.

<Warning>
  A B-frame is short for bi-directional frame, and they [commonly occur with
  default OBS settings](/developers/guides/stream-via-obs). Ensure you instruct
  any OBS users to turn off b-frames for the best livestream experience.
</Warning>
