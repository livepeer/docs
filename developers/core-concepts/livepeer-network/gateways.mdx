A Gateway (formerly known as a Broadcaster) on the Livepeer network
is a node that is using the network for video streaming or generative AI inference.
Running a gateway is simple, and it exposes an API that allows you to build
your video application on top of Livepeer.
Under the hood, gateways are responsible for routing transcoding or
AI inference tasks to the appropriate
[Orchestrator](/developers/core-concepts/livepeer-network/orchestrators)
nodes for processing. By running the
[`go-livepeer` client](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer), individuals can
join the Livepeer network as Gateways.

#### Configuration

Gateways do not need to stake
[LPT](/developers/core-concepts/livepeer-network/delegators#livepeer-token-lpt)
to participate in the network. They only
[require enough ETH](/gateways/guides/fund-gateway) to cover the cost of
transcoding and AI inference jobs. Unlike Orchestrators, Gateways do not need a
GPU to participate. Any machine with a decent CPU and sufficient bandwidth can
operate as a Gateway.

Gateways are essential components of the Livepeer ecosystem, serving as the
bridge between the Orchestrators performing the work and the clients requesting
the work. Many entities may run gateway nodes and make them available to others
as a hosted service. They often provide additional services such as content delivery
networks (CDNs) and base currency subscriptions, ensuring that jobs are
delivered swiftly to the right client and that clients don't need to set up
crypto wallets themselves.
