The Livepeer Player is a drop-in React component that you can put in your web or native mobile application (with React Native) to play assets/livestreams.
It provides a responsive UI based on video player dimensions and playback type, poster image support, and modern video player capabilities.

An embeddable version is also hosted at `https://lvpr.tv`, with many of the props exposed via query params, so that you can easily embed it using
an iframe.

#### Playback

The Player is optimized for low latency playback:

- [Livestream playback](/developers/guides/playback-a-livestream) prioritizes low latency WebRTC using WHEP (by default)
- [Asset playback](/developers/guides/playback-an-asset) prioritizes [MP4 renditions](/sdks/livepeer-js/Player#mp4-playback-urls),
  which are cached with a CDN for rapid delivery

If any of these options fail, it will fall back to HLS playback, using [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js). This ensures a smooth
viewing experience for your users.

There is also [custom retry logic](/sdks/livepeer-js/Player#technical-details) in the Player to make sure that if a livestream is offline or there are any transient
network issues, playback will be retried.

#### Embed

To embed the Player, a URL can be added to an iframe similar to:

```bash
https://lvpr.tv?v={playbackId}&lowLatency=true
```

To see all of the available query parameters, see the [embeddable player](/developers/guides/playback-an-asset#embeddable-player) section.

#### Metrics

The Livepeer Player reports engagement metrics without any extra configuration. These metrics can then be queried using the
[viewership API](/developers/guides/get-engagement-analytics-via-api) and shown alongside the Player, for display of view count
and other valuable viewership data.
