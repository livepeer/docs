The Livepeer Studio CLI is a command line tool that helps you generate a new
Livepeer app in just a few seconds.

## Getting Started

First, create a Livepeer API key
[here](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/api-keys). Next, use the CLI
to generate a new project.

```sh
npx @livepeer/create
```

When prompted, enter your Livepeer **API key** and **Stream ID**.

Once the app has been created, `cd` into the new directory and run the start
command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
