  "Learn how to automatically upload and play back a video on IPFS and Arweave
  with Livepeer React"

Playing back transcoded video from IPFS or Arweave is easy with Livepeer! The
example below uses the Player's built-in capabilities to transcode IPFS/Arweave
content without any additional configuration.

<Info>
  This guide is written for developers using `@livepeer/react` in a React
  application.
</Info>

IPFS is a network of nodes that allow you to read content from the network using
a content identifier unique to the data you’re requesting, ensuring you are able
to securely and verifiably get exactly what you are asking for, regardless of
where the data is physically stored. Arweave is a set of nodes that are
incentivized to store data permanently; content stored on the network is pulled
through an Arweave gateway.

<Warning>
  **This example illustrates how Livepeer can be used as a video processing and
  caching layer on top of content available on IPFS or the Arweave gateway for
  optimized video playback.** We recommend uploading via `useCreateAsset` or the
  API before displaying it in the player for best performance. For comprehensive
  IPFS / Arweave support we offer a fallback option to play directly from
  IPFS/Arweave while the video is being uploaded to Livepeer, but do not
  recommend it for typical usage because it may result in long load times for
  viewers.
</Warning>

For rapid processing of assets that will also be archived on IPFS or Arweave, we
strongly encourage either (1) uploading to Livepeer with the storage option
enabled, or (2) uploading the raw file to Livepeer via `useCreateAsset` or the
API prior to archiving on dStorage, rather than passing the IPFS / Arweave
gateway URL. The gateway URL will work, but may incur longer-than-usual
processing time.

To see a complete example of using dStorage playback in React, see our
[example app on Github](https://github.com/suhailkakar/livepeer-dStorage-playback).

### Configuring Providers

We
[create a new React client and wrap the app with `LivepeerConfig`](/sdks/livepeer-react/getting-started).

#### Automatic Playback

Now that our providers are set up, we can add a text input for an IPFS CID or an
IPFS/Arweave HTTP gateway URL.

<Info>
  For IPFS HTTP gateway URLs, the Studio provider currently only supports “path
  style” URLs and does not support “subdomain style” URLs. The Studio provider
  will support both styles of URLs in a future update.
</Info>

The raw input is passed to the [`Player`](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root),
which automatically detects if it is a valid CID and attempts to fetch the
playback info for that CID. If the provider does not have an `Asset` with that
CID, the Player will automatically attempt to upload the CID from IPFS, and then
play the transcoded content back, without any additional code on the frontend.
To ensure that there is no delay in playback, we recommend uploading via
`useCreateAsset` before displaying it in the player.

```tsx DecentralizedStoragePlayback.tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";
import { parseArweaveTxId, parseCid } from "@livepeer/core-web/utils";

import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

export const DecentralizedStoragePlayback = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState<string>("");

  const idParsed = useMemo(() => parseCid(url) ?? parseArweaveTxId(url), [url]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>IPFS or Arweave URL</p>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="ipfs://... or ar://"
        onChange={(e) => setUrl(e.target.value)}
      />

      {url && !idParsed && <p>Provided value is not a valid identifier.</p>}

      {idParsed && (
        <Player
          title={idParsed.id}
          src={url}
          autoPlay
          muted
          autoUrlUpload={{ fallback: true, ipfsGateway: "https://w3s.link" }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
