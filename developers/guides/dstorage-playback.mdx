Playing back transcoded video from IPFS or Arweave is easy with livepeer.js! The example below uses the Player's built-in capabilities to transcode IPFS/Arweave content without any additional configuration.

<Info>
  This guide is written for developers using `@livepeer/react` in a React
  application.
</Info>

IPFS is a network of nodes that allow you to read content from the network using a content identifier unique to the data you’re requesting, ensuring you are able to securely and verifiably get exactly what you are asking for, regardless of where the data is physically stored. Arweave is a set of nodes that are incentivized to store data permanently; content stored on the network is pulled through an Arweave gateway.

<Warning>
  **This example illustrates how Livepeer can be used as a video processing and
  caching layer on top of content available on IPFS or the Arweave gateway for
  optimized video playback.** We recommend uploading via `useCreateAsset` or
  the API before displaying it in the player for best performance. For
  comprehensive IPFS / Arweave support we offer a fallback option to play
  directly from IPFS/Arweave while the video is being uploaded to Livepeer, but
  do not recommend it for typical usage because it may result in long load times
  for viewers.
</Warning>

For rapid processing of assets that will also be archived on IPFS or
Arweave, we strongly encourage either (1) uploading to Livepeer with the storage option enabled,
or (2) uploading the raw file to Livepeer via `useCreateAsset` or the API
prior to archiving on dStorage, rather than passing the IPFS / Arweave gateway
URL. The gateway URL will work, but may incur longer-than-usual processing
time.

To see a complete example of using dStorage playback in React, see our
[example app on
Github](https://github.com/suhailkakar/livepeer-dStorage-playback).

### Configuring Providers

We [create a new livepeer.js client and wrap the app with `LivepeerConfig`](/sdks/livepeer-js/getting-started).

#### Automatic Playback

Now that our providers are set up, we can add a text input for an IPFS CID or an IPFS/Arweave HTTP gateway URL.

<Info>
  For IPFS HTTP gateway URLs, the Studio provider currently only supports “path
  style” URLs and does not support “subdomain style” URLs. The Studio provider
  will support both styles of URLs in a future update.
</Info>

The raw input is passed to the [`Player`](/sdks/livepeer-js/Player), which automatically detects if it is a valid CID and attempts
to fetch the playback info for that CID. If the provider does not have an `Asset` with that CID, the Player will automatically attempt
to upload the CID from IPFS, and then play the transcoded content back, without any additional code on the frontend. To ensure that there is no delay in playback, we recommend uploading via `useCreateAsset` before displaying it in the player.

```tsx DecentralizedStoragePlayback.tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";
import { parseArweaveTxId, parseCid } from "livepeer/media";

import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

export const DecentralizedStoragePlayback = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState<string>("");

  const idParsed = useMemo(() => parseCid(url) ?? parseArweaveTxId(url), [url]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>IPFS or Arweave URL</p>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="ipfs://... or ar://"
        onChange={(e) => setUrl(e.target.value)}
      />

      {url && !idParsed && <p>Provided value is not a valid identifier.</p>}

      {idParsed && (
        <Player
          title={idParsed.id}
          src={url}
          autoPlay
          muted
          autoUrlUpload={{ fallback: true, ipfsGateway: "https://w3s.link" }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
