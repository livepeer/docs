Uploading and watching an asset is easy! The example below uses the
[Create Asset API](/api-reference/asset/upload) to create an upload URL to
upload a video.

<Info>
  Livepeer supports resumable uploads through the TUS protocol, which helps with
  reliability and efficiency when transferring large assets.
</Info>

Livepeer provides two options for uploading assets:

- **`PUT` Upload**: Upload assets via simple HTTP verbs for processing and play
  back.
- **Tus Resumable Upload**: Discover the power of resumable uploads, ensuring
  reliability and efficiency when transferring your media files.

## Using Livepeer's SDKs

We can use one of the Livepeer SDKs to create a
[Tus-compatible](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) upload endpoint.

We can then use Tus on the frontend to directly upload the asset to Livepeer.

    const assetData = {
      name: fileName
    };

    livepeer
      .asset.create(assetData)
      .then((response) => {

      })
      .catch((error) => {

Once an upload endpoint is created, you can use it to upload your video file to
Livepeer. The upload endpoint is tus compatible, so you can use any
tus-compatible client (like
[tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client)) to upload your video file
from the frontend.

<Info>
  **For rapid processing of assets that will also be archived on IPFS or
  Arweave, we strongly encourage either (1) uploading to Livepeer with the [IPFS
  storage option
  enabled](/developers/tutorials/upload-playback-videos-on-ipfs#uploading-videos-to-ipfs),
  or (2) uploading the raw file to the API prior to archiving on dStorage,
  rather than passing the IPFS / Arweave gateway URL. The gateway URL will work,
  but may incur longer-than-usual processing time.**
</Info>

### IPFS and Arweave sources

<Info>
  IPFS is a network of nodes that allow you to read content from the network
  using a content identifier unique to the data youâ€™re requesting, ensuring you
  are able to verifiably get exactly what you are asking for, regardless of
  where the data is physically stored. Arweave is a set of nodes that are
  incentivized to store data permanently; content stored on the network is
  pulled through an Arweave gateway.
