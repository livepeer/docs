## Overview

Projects in Livepeer Studio allow for the organization of streaming assets, API
keys, and usage within dedicated environments. This feature is crucial for
separating staging and production environments, managing multiple applications,
and ensuring efficient workflow within a single account.

## Why Use Projects?

- **Separation of Environments**: Keep your staging and production environments
  separate to avoid conflicts and ensure reliable testing.
- **Centralized Management for Multiple Applications**: Instead of juggling
  multiple accounts, you can build and manage separate applications from within
  the same account. This is ideal for developers and companies that operate
  multiple apps or brands and wish to streamline their management in one place.

## Getting Started with Projects

### Creating a New Project

To start building with separate environments or applications, you'll need to
create a new project. Here's how:

1. In the sidebar, click on the project dropdown at the top of the menu.
2. Choose **+ New project** from the dropdown list.
3. Enter a name for your new project when prompted.
4. Confirm the creation to set up your new environment.


### Renaming a Project

1. Within a project, navigate to the **Settings** section in the sidebar.
2. Find the project name field, make your changes, and save.


### Deleting a Project

  In the current version of Livepeer Studio, you **cannot** delete a project. But we are working on adding this feature soon.

{/* #### Recommended Pre-Deletion Steps:

1. **Backup**: Confirm that you have secured backups of all essential data.
2. **Verification:** Ensure that the project is no longer in use and all
   necessary migrations have been completed.

#### Deletion Steps:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** option in the project's sidebar to access the
   detailed settings view.
2. Scroll down to find the Delete Project section.
3. Click on the **Delete** button.
4. As a safety measure, you will be prompted to type in the name of the project
   to confirm your intent to delete.
5. After typing the name, proceed by confirming the deletion. */}

## Conclusion

With the introduction of Projects, Livepeer Studio provides you with a powerful
way to manage your application's live and on-demand streams. By leveraging the
ability to create separate projects for staging and production, you can
streamline your workflows and ensure a clean separation of your streaming
environments.
