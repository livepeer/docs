For video assets we provide a way to retrieve a list of thumbnails for your video assets. Thumbnails will be generated as part of the upload processing, one per segment of video.

Follow the steps below to find out how to use this.

## Step 1. Upload an asset

Follow our previous guide on
[uploading an asset](/developers/guides/upload-video-asset). Note down the `playbackId`.

## Step 2. Fetch playback info

Once the processing has completed for your asset, fetch the playback info using the [playback info API endpoint](/api-reference/playback/get).

Example response:
```json
{
    "type": "vod",
    "meta": {
        "playbackPolicy": null,
        "source": [
            {
                "hrn": "HLS (TS)",
                "type": "html5/application/vnd.apple.mpegurl",
                "url": "https://vod-cdn.lp-playback.studio/raw/jxf4iblf6wlsyor6526t4tcmtmqa/catalyst-vod-com/hls/95c9ih1y6tl97xbx/index.m3u8"
            },
            {
                "hrn": "Thumbnails",
                "type": "text/vtt",
                "url": "https://vod-cdn.lp-playback.studio/raw/jxf4iblf6wlsyor6526t4tcmtmqa/catalyst-vod-com/hls/95c9ih1y6tl97xbx/thumbnails/thumbnails.vtt"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You should see an entry in the `source` array with the type `text/vtt`. This file uses the [WebVTT format](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/) to represent the thumbnails associated with each time point in the video.

This format was chosen with the use case of thumbnail scrubbing in mind, to allow a player to overlay thumbnail images as the user is seeking through a video, but it allows more general usage of selecting a desired time in your video and fetching a thumbnail for it.

## Step 3. Download the VTT file

Fetch the VTT file from the URL found above (an HTTP `GET`).

Example VTT response:
```
WEBVTT
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
keyframes_0.jpg

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
keyframes_1.jpg

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
keyframes_2.jpg
```

## Step 4. Download a thumbnail

Use one of the JPG paths to download a thumbnail. As an example if your VTT URL for the above was `https://vod-cdn.lp-playback.studio/catalyst-vod-com/hls/ac906f1cs0oe9rb1/thumbnails/thumbnails.vtt` then you could fetch the first frame of the video with `https://vod-cdn.lp-playback.studio/catalyst-vod-com/hls/ac906f1cs0oe9rb1/thumbnails/keyframes_0.jpg`.
