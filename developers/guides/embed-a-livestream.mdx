In this guide, we demonstrate how to embed a livestream in your application
using a hosted version of the Livepeer Player.

<Warning>
  If you are using React, consider using Livepeer UI Kit instead.
</Warning>

This is one of the easiest ways to play back a livestream on your website. You
can embed the player by using the below code snippet.

You can replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your video's playback id.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv?v={PLAYBACK_ID}"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>
```

## Low Latency

Livestreams will play back with low-latency WebRTC. If this does not succeed in
playing back (commonly due to a slow network or connectivity issues), the
embeddable player will automatically fall back to HLS playback. Also, if the
stream contains B-frames (or bidirectional frames, which are common for users
streaming with OBS or other streaming apps), the Player will automatically fall
back to HLS, so that out-of-order frames are not displayed. _This only applies
to users who are playing livestreams._

If you do not want to use WebRTC, you can pass `&lowLatency=false` in the query
string, or if you want _only_ low latency, you can pass `&lowLatency=force`.

<Warning>
  OBS users should be instructed to use the Livepeer Studio stream profile, or
  to manually turn off B-frames in their stream. See our [Stream from
  OBS](/developers/guides/stream-via-obs) docs for more information.
</Warning>

## Clipping

To enable clipping, `&clipLength={seconds}` can be passed, which will allow
viewers to clip livestreams. The length in seconds **must be less than 120
seconds**.

## Constant Playback

The embed supports "constant" playback with `constant=true`, which means that
audio will not be distorted if the playhead falls behind the livestream. This is
usually used for music applications, where audio quality/consistency is more
important than latency.

## Other Configs

You can also override the default `muted` and `autoplay` behavior with
`&muted=false` and/or `&autoplay=false`. These are set to true by default.
Looping can also be set with `&loop=true`.
