Adding access control to a video on-demand only takes a few lines of code.

<Info>
  This guide is written for developers using `@livepeer/react` in a React
  application.
</Info>

The example below uses `useCreateAsset` and a webhook to create and watch a gated video on-demand.

### Create an Access Control Webhook Handler

Set up an endpoint (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api/check-access) to handle the logic for granting or denying access to your assets.
This endpoint should accept a POST request with a JSON payload containing the access key and webhook context.

This is an example of a payload this endpoint would receive:

```json POST /api/check-access
{
  "accessKey": "your-access-key",
  "context": {
    "assetId": "abcd1234",
    "userId": "user5678"
  },
  "timestamp": 1680530722502
}
```

The payload in `context` is defined by your application.

### Register an Access Control Webhook

Use the [Livepeer Studio dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/webhooks) to create a new webhook with the type `playback.accessControl` and specify the URL of your access control endpoint.

You can then use the ID of the webhook in the next step.

### Create an asset with a playback policy webhook

You can now create an asset with a playback policy webhook, passing the ID of the webhook you created in Step 2.

```tsx
import { useCreateAsset } from "@livepeer/react";

import { useCallback, useState, useMemo } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

export const CreateAndViewAsset = () => {
  const [video, setVideo] = useState<File | undefined>();
  const {
    mutate: createAsset,
    data: asset,
    status: createStatus,
    progress,
    error: createError,
  } = useCreateAsset(
    video
      ? {
          sources: [
            {
              name: video.name,
              file: video,
              playbackPolicy: {
                type: "webhook",
                // This is the id of the webhook you created in step 2
                webhookId: "<webhook_id>",
                webhookContext: {
                  // This is the context you want to pass to your webhook
                  // It can be anything you want, and it will be passed back to your webhook
                },
              },
            },
          ] as const,
        }
      : null
  );

  const onDrop = useCallback(async (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    if (acceptedFiles && acceptedFiles.length > 0 && acceptedFiles?.[0]) {
      setVideo(acceptedFiles[0]);
    }
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    accept: {
      "video/*": ["*.mp4"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
    onDrop,
  });

  const progressFormatted = useMemo(
    () =>
      progress?.[0].phase === "failed"
        ? "Failed to process video."
        : progress?.[0].phase === "waiting"
        ? "Waiting"
        : progress?.[0].phase === "uploading"
        ? `Uploading: ${Math.round(progress?.[0]?.progress * 100)}%`
        : progress?.[0].phase === "processing"
        ? `Processing: ${Math.round(progress?.[0].progress * 100)}%`
        : null,
    [progress]
  );

  return (
    <>
      <div {...getRootProps()}>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <p>Drag and drop or browse files</p>
      </div>

      {createError?.message && <p>{createError.message}</p>}

      {video ? <p>{video.name}</p> : <p>Select a video file to upload.</p>}
      {progressFormatted && <p>{progressFormatted}</p>}

      <button
        onClick={() => {
          createAsset?.();
        }}
        disabled={!createAsset || createStatus === "loading"}
      >
        Upload
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Configure the Player with an Access Key

If you are using the Livepeer.js Player, you can use the [`accessKey`](/sdks/livepeer-js/Player#accesskey)
prop to provide your custom access key, which is then passed to the webhook you created to verify that it is valid.

```tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

export const CreateAndViewAsset = () => {
  const accessKey = getAccessKeyForYourApplication();

  return <Player playbackId={playbackId} accessKey={accessKey} />;
};
```

If you are not using the player, you will need to manually append the access key to the m3u8 URL as a query parameter, similar to:

```
https://playback.livepeer.studio/asset/hls/abcd1234/index.m3u8?accessKey=your-access-key
```

### Receive the Webhook from Livepeer

When a user attempts to access the VOD asset, Livepeer will call your access control endpoint with the access key and webhook context.
Your endpoint should process the request and return a response indicating whether the stream access should be allowed or disallowed.

Here is an example request sent to your access control endpoint:

```json
{
  "context": {
    // Same value from the `asset.playbackPolicy.webhookContext` field
  },
  "accessKey": "<access_key>" // this is exact value of the prop passed to the Player, or the query parameter
}
```

In your access control endpoint, implement the logic to verify the access key and decide whether to grant access to the VOD asset.
If the access is allowed, return a `2XX` response. Otherwise, the playback will be disallowed.
