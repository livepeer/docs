Livepeer Studio uses webhooks to communicate with your application
asynchronously when events for your asset occur. For example, you may want to
know when an asset has been `uploaded` or is `ready`, so that you can surface this
information to viewers.

When these events happen, you can configure Studio to make a `POST` request to a webhook URL that you specify.

### Type of asset events

|                 |                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `asset.created` | This fires when a On Demand asset is created.                                                                           |
| `asset.updated` | This fires when a On Demand asset is updated. The asset payload will contain a playback URL when playback is available. |
| `asset.ready`   | This fires when a On Demand asset is ready. Playback will be available with all transcoded renditions.                  |
| `asset.failed`  | This fires when a On Demand asset fails during the upload or during processing.                                         |
| `asset.deleted` | This fires when a On Demand asset is deleted.                                                                           |

### Set up a webhook endpoint

The first step is to set up a webhook endpoint in your application. This is the URL that Livepeer Studio will send the event to - learn more about [setting up a webhook endpoint](/developers/guides/setup-and-listen-to-webhooks).

### Add a webhook URL to Livepeer Studio

Log in to the [Livepeer Studio](https://studio.livepeer.org/) and navigate to the [Developers/Webhooks](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/webhooks) page.
