In this guide, we demonstrate how to play back assets in your application using
either Livepeer React or Video.js.

<Warning>
  In a production application, with [CORS-enabled API
  keys](/api-reference/overview/authentication), the viewer **should not have
  access** to the asset ID. The `playbackId` should be passed to the viewer
  only, since this allows the viewer to watch the asset.
</Warning>

## Using the Livepeer React Player

The example below show to use the Livepeer React
[`Player`](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root) to view a video asset, with some
custom styles to demonstrate what's possible.

<iframe

  frameborder="0"
  width="100%"
    height="410"

### Configuring Providers

We
[create a new React client and wrap the app with `LivepeerConfig`](/sdks/livepeer-react/getting-started).

### Play Video

Now that our providers are set up, we use the
[`Player`](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root) with an IPFS CID as our
`playbackId`, which we created previously when uploading a video asset and
storing to IPFS. We use
[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) as
our optimized poster image, but this could also be a simple image URL.

We also override some of the custom styling to match the flow of our app!

```tsx DemoPlayer.tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

import Image from "next/image";

const playbackId = "f5eese9wwl88k4g8";

import blenderPoster from "../../public/images/blender-poster.png";

const PosterImage = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={blenderPoster}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

export const DemoPlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Waterfalls"
      playbackId={playbackId}
      showPipButton
      showTitle={false}
      aspectRatio="16to9"
      poster={<PosterImage />}
      controls={{
        autohide: 3000,
      }}
      theme={{
        borderStyles: { containerBorderStyle: "hidden" },
        radii: { containerBorderRadius: "10px" },
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## Using your own player

Using Livepeer React is the recommended way to play back a video or a
livestream - it handles MP4 renditions, errors from the API, and is a true
web3-native media player. However, if you want to use an alternative, you can do
so by following the instructions below.

<Info>
  To ensure consistent viewer experience, we strongly recommend using a player
  (like the Livepeer Player) that handles choosing the correct MP4 rendition and
  gracefully recovers from routine RTMP reconnects through custom polling logic.
  In the absence of this capability, reconnects may severely degrade viewer
  experience and require a hard refresh to resolve, and an incorrect MP4
  rendition for the screen size may be chosen.
</Info>

### Fetch the playback URL

To play back a livestream in other players, you'll need to fetch the playback
URL(s). By default, all content has an HLS endpoint. HLS is a protocol that
allows you to stream video and audio content over HTTP.

<Warning>
  The playback URL format is subject to change. Do not try to create the
  playback URLs manually, as they may change periodically.
</Warning>

You can get the playback details for an asset by using the
[playback info API endpoint](/api-reference/playback/get). The `url` field can
be used as the playback URL.

#### Source playback

When an asset is initially created, we will provide a "source playback" URL in
the list returned from the
[playback info endpoint](/api-reference/playback/get). This is a non-transcoded
version of the asset that can be played immediately, while processing happens in
the background. The playback info endpoint will then automatically update with
the transcoded renditions when processing is completed.

### Handling various playback sources

The playback info endpoint can return multiple sources in the response. These
may include short form MP4 playback URLs, which allow you to obtain alternative
URLs for your video asset to enable applications (and CDNs) to cache short
videos for instant playback of subsequent videos. This means that viewers can
experience instant time-to-first-frame (TTFF) when watching short videos.

It is important to note that short form playback URLs are only available for
video assets that are less than 2 minutes in duration.

These may also include WebRTC URLs for low latency livestream playback. These
_must_ be played back with our ICE servers, which are used to route traffic in
restricted networking environments.

If there are MP4 renditions or WebRTC playback available, the
[playback info endpoint](/api-reference/playback/get) will return:

```json
{
  "type": "vod",
  "meta": {
    "source": [
      {
        "hrn": "MP4",
        "type": "html5/video/mp4",
        "url": "https://asset-cdn.lp-playback.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/static360p0.mp4",
        "size": 494778,
        "width": 204,
        "height": 360,
        "bitrate": 449890
      },
      {
        "hrn": "MP4",
        "type": "html5/video/mp4",
        "url": "https://asset-cdn.lp-playback.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/static720p0.mp4",
        "size": 1869154,
        "width": 406,
        "height": 720,
        "bitrate": 1996936
      },
      {
        "hrn": "HLS (TS)",
        "type": "html5/application/vnd.apple.mpegurl",
        "url": "https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/{RECORDING_ID}/index.m3u8"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

There are multiple renditions you can choose from, and it is up to you to decide
how you want to prioritize each source for your custom player. See the
[Player's technical details](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root#technical-details)
for more information on how Livepeer React handles this.

<Info>
  When you make a request for playback URLs, in the response MP4 URLs are always
  listed before HLS URLs. Additionally, each MP4 URL includes additional
  metadata about the video, such as its width, height, bitrate, and size. This
  metadata can be useful for mobile applications that want to optimize playback
  quality and size based on the viewer's device and network conditions. **The
  Livepeer React Player automatically handles this.** See the [Player
  docs](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root#technical-details) for more
  information.
</Info>

### Use the playback URL in a player

You can use the playback URL with any video player that supports HLS. Here is a
list of popular players that support HLS:

- [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)
- [Plyr.io](https://plyr.io/)
- [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/html5-video-player/)
- [Bitmovin Player](https://bitmovin.com/video-player/)
- [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) (requires custom logic to wire
  to a video element)

Here is an example of how to use the playback URL in video.js player.

```html
<head>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" />

  <!-- If you'd like to support IE8 (for Video.js versions prior to v7) -->
  <!-- <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/ie8/1.1.2/videojs-ie8.min.js"></script> -->
</head>

<body>
  <video
    id="my-video"
    class="video-js"
    controls
    preload="auto"
    width="640"
    height="264"
    poster="MY_VIDEO_POSTER.jpg"
  >
    <source
      src="https://lp-playback.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/index.m3u8"
      type="application/x-mpegURL"
    />
  </video>

  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Embeddable Player

Livepeer Studio maintains an
[embeddable version of the Livepeer Player](/developers/guides/embed-a-player)
that is suitable for iframing or similar embeddings. See the guide for more
details.
