[Multistreaming](/developers/core-concepts/core-api/multistream) allows a source stream and transcoded renditions to be pushed to
multiple RTMP(S) targets, such as Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live.

## Multistream targets with the API

You can manage multistream target objects from
the API - see the [API reference](/api-reference/multistream/create).
Each target represents a specific endpoint where a stream could be
multistreamed to.

Note that the creation of a multistream target itself is not enough - you also need to reference the target from the
stream object that should be multistreamed. To avoid managing the separate
multistream target objects, you can also create the targets inlined in the
stream [creation](/api-reference/stream/create) and [update](/api-reference/stream/update) APIs.

<Info>
  Any changes to multistream targets, including creating new targets, will apply
  only to the next active session. If you make changes while a stream is active,
  those changes will not apply until the current session has ended and a new
  session begins.
</Info>

## Multistream targets in the Studio dashboard

To add, manage, and delete multistream targets, navigate to the [Streams page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams)
and click on a stream name. On the stream detail page, on the Overview tab,
you can view all configured targets. You must configure new
multistream targets for each stream. This will apply the multistream
configuration to that stream. Multistream targets **do not carry over when you
create new streams.**

To add a new target, click Create on the right side of the
multistream targets section. You'll be asked to name your target, provide the
Ingest URL and a stream key, being Ingest URL the only required value. The
Ingest URL and stream key should be provided by the platform that you're
streaming into and can be of the RTMP, RTMPS or SRT protocols. Select the
rendition profile that you'd like to send to that target and click
Create Target. Once created, you can toggle the targets on and off.

To edit a multistream target, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on Edit to open up the target settings. Select
Update Target when you've completed your changes.

To delete a multistream target, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on Delete.

<Info>
  Any changes to multistream targets, including creating new targets, will apply
  only to the next active session. If you make changes while a stream is active,
  those changes will not apply until the current session has ended and a new
  session begins.

## Understanding Multistream Performance

### Dashboard

While a session is active that has multistream targets configured, you'll be
able to see if a destination is `Active` or `Offline`.

<Info>
  There may be a slight delay between starting the stream and the push
  destinations connecting. When starting to stream to multistream targets, use
  these indicators to understand whether it has connected to its target(s).
</Info>

On the stream page where you've configured your multistream targets, select the
Health tab at the top. While a session is active, you'll see the ingest rate
of the source stream.

### Webhooks

There are three webhooks to help you monitor the state of your multistream targets:

- `multistream.connected`: When Studio has successfully connected to the
  multistream target and you're also online in the other service you are
  multistreaming to.
- `multistream.error`: In case any error has occurred during connection to the
  multistream target. This means some kind of problem with the configuration
  or the other service you are multistreaming to.
- `multistream.disconnected`: Sent after a stream is ended to indicate that
  Multistream has also ended for the respective target.
