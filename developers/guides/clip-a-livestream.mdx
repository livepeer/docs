## Introduction

You can use Livepeer Studio to create clips of active streams provided via API.
Currently, you can create clips from the most recent N seconds of a given
stream. You may also clip specific sections of a long-running stream, such as a
particular session from a live-streamed conference.

This guide offers a comprehensive walkthrough of the clipping functionality.

## Create a stream

Follow our previous guide on
[creating a stream](/developers/guides/create-livestream) to get a stream key to
provide to the creator on your platform. You can then start a Livestream and
note down the `playbackId`.

## Call the Clip API

<Info>
  Clips are created from the perspective of the user who initiates the clip. For
  example, if a viewer clips the most recent 30 seconds, it will be the most
  recent 30 seconds that they saw.
</Info>

Submit a request to the `api/clip` API using the following request parameters:

<ParamField path="startTime" type="number">
  UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) of clip's start from the browser’s playhead
  (commonly supplied by HLS players).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="endTime" type="number">
  UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) of clip's end from the browser’s playhead
  (commonly supplied by HLS players).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="playbackId" type="string">
  Active stream's Playback ID
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  (Optional) Output clip's name
</ParamField>

<b>Note</b>: Ensure the startTime aligns with or postdates the stream's
initiation, and that the endTime isn't set in the future.

<Info>
  Tip: HLS players typically provide a Program-Date-Time for each segment when
  parsing an HLS manifest. You can utilize these Program-Date-Times to create a
  clipping user interface (UI) and generate the correct timestamps.
</Info>

### API + Player Integration

If you are using HLS.js, it provides an API for getting the program date time,
`hls.playingDate`, which can be used to get the browser’s current playhead. This
returns a Date object which is used similar to:

```tsx
import Hls from "hls.js";

const hls = new Hls();

// Assuming you have already connected HLS.js to a video element

const endTime = hls.playingDate.getTime(); // This retrieves the current playing date from HLS.js
const startTime = endTime - 30000; // 30 seconds before the endTime in milliseconds

const playbackId = process.env.PLAYBACK_ID_OF_RUNNING_STREAM;
const apiToken = process.env.PUBLIC_CORS_API_TOKEN;

const data: ClipData = {
  startTime,
  endTime,
  playbackId,
  name: "Your clip name",
};

const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${apiToken}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

async function createClip() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/clip", {
      method: "POST",
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });

    const responseData: ClipResponse = await response.json();

    console.log(responseData.asset.id);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

interface ClipData {
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  playbackId: string;
  name?: string;
}

interface ClipResponse {
  task: {
    id: string;
  };
  asset: {
    id: string;
    playbackId: string;
    userId: string;
    createdAt: number;
    status: {
      phase: string;
      updatedAt: number;
    };
    name: string;
    source: {
      type: string;
      sessionId: string;
    };
    objectStoreId: string;
  };
}
```

If you are using the Livepeer Player, you can pass in
[`clipLength` to enable the clipping button](/sdks/livepeer-react/player/Root#cliplength),
alongside the clip callbacks. These are called when the user initiates a clip
with the built-in Player clip button. The asset ID can then be used to poll the
API and get updates on the processing status.

```tsx
<Player
  playbackId={playbackId}
  clipLength={30}
  onClipStarted={onClipStarted}
  onClipCreated={onClipCreated}
  onClipError={onClipError}
/>
```

## Monitor the clip's status

After calling the clip API, Livepeer generates an asset. You'll receive the
asset's details in the response.

```json
{
  "task": {
    "id": "635cbcbb-30cb-4136-a7f0-ec5ea2ac39d0"
  },
  "asset": {
    "id": "e28c63c6-ffe8-4f0f-8ae0-4fbbe5c7b493",
    "playbackId": "e28crdyrtxjkx836",
    "userId": "8f175616-1a6d-4481-86f5-7351c041b5ca",
    "createdAt": 1695835443441,
    "status": {
      "phase": "waiting",
      "updatedAt": 1695835443441
    },
    "name": "My Clip",
    "source": {
      "type": "clip",
      "sessionId": "e0d88141-8ade-4274-9039-360245283645"
    },
    "objectStoreId": "9b526cee-bd25-44d2-9fda-f98db3a38a48"
  }
}
```

There are two approaches to track the clip's status:

- **using the `/api/asset/$ASSET_ID` API**

You can poll this endpoint to retrieve the current status of the asset. Keep
polling until the `asset.status` field is `ready`.

- **using webhooks**

If you have configured a webhook in Livepeer to listen for the `asset.ready`
event, you will receive a notification when the clip processing is complete. You
can use the `assetId` received in the previous response to determine when your
clip is ready.

To determine if an asset you are polling or receiving as an event is a clip, you
can check the `source` field. If the `source` field contains a `clip` type and
the relative session ID, then it is indeed a clip.

You can always fetch clips by stream using the API:

```tsx
const playbackId = process.env.PLAYBACK_ID_OF_RUNNING_STREAM;
const clipsByStream = await fetch(
  "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/" + playbackId + "/clips",
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers,
  }
);

// Alternatively, you can use the streamId or fetch the clips
// by session using the /api/session/$sessionId/clips endpoint.
```

<Info>
  Tip: Clips offer source playback just like other assets. On completion, a
  transcode job is triggered. Even before this job concludes, the source
  playback becomes available. The playbackUrl field in the asset gets populated
  when the playback is ready, and the sourcePlayback field is set to true.
</Info>

## Get your clip!

A clip generated in Livepeer is the same of any other Livepeer asset. You are
able to get the playback URLs in your asset object, or fetching them from the
`/api/playback/$PLAYBACK_ID` API, providing the playbackId of the output asset
representing the clip.
