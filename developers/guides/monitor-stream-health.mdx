title: Monitor stream health
description: Learn how to monitor stream metrics on Livepeer
---

This guide provides instructions and information about using stream metrics to:

- Monitor any active stream for issues that may impact the quality of your
  stream
- Understand the metrics for operating a livestreaming or user generated content
  platform
- View health status of your livestream (API and Dashboard No-Code Option)

## Metrics with Source Segments Duration

The value of `sourceSegmentsDuration` returned is the duration in seconds of the
asset source processed by Livepeer Studio. On the parent stream object, this
value equates to the total amount of source video ingested by Livepeer Studio
all time. On the session object, this value is the length of the livestream
session (or the session recording).

### Request

Use the [get stream](/api-reference/stream/get) endpoint to retrieve a stream,
or

### Response

- Returns a `200` response with the following object:

```json
{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "id": "ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
  "createdAt": 1596081229373,
  "streamKey": "abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
  "playbackId": "efghb2mxupongp5k",
  "isActive": "true",
  "lastSeen": 1596119750455,
  "sourceSegments": 1360,
  "transcodedSegments": 5480,
  "sourceSegmentsDuration": 2630.53200000000004,
  "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 10620.1280000000004
  // other asset object keys, like profiles and parentId
}
```

### Global Health Status

- `Healthy` indicates that all the Health Checks are in a `Healthy` state.
- `Unhealthy` indicates that one or more of the Health Checks are in an
  `Unhealthy` state
- `Idle` indicates that the stream is not currently active

### Health Checks

- **_Transcoding_** — A `Healthy` status indicates that video transcoding is
  occurring, and the multiple profiles of your stream are available for
  playback. An `Unhealthy` status indicates that we have failed to generate the
  profiles, so only the original video will be available. Check the event log
  below for any actionable errors, or check the
  [Status page](https://livepeer.statuspage.io/) for platform-wide issues.
- **_Real-time —_** This indicates whether our system transcoded the stream
  faster than in real-time. In other words, if the video transcodes, latency is
  lower than the video duration. Unconventional configurations may cause an
  `Unhealthy` status.
- **_Multistreaming —_** This health check indicates whether all configured
  `multistream targets` are connected. If no targets exist, this will appear
  blank and not be considered for the global health state. If this shows up as
  `Unhealthy`, you can also check the status of the individual
  `multistream targets` in the `Overview` tab, where the targets can be either
  `Idle`, `Pending`, `Online'or' Offline`:
  - An `Idle` status indicates that the stream is not currently active, so
    neither is multistreaming.
  - A `Pending` status indicates that our system tries connecting to the
    respective `multistream target`.
  - An `Online` status indicates that the `multistream target` is successfully
    connected.
  - An `Offline` status means that we've received an error when trying to
    connect to the target. To try again, check the ingest URL and stream key of
    your destination service, re-configure your `multistream target` and restart
    your stream.

### Logs

Logs will surface informational alerts (ex., stream has started/stopped,
multistream destinations have connected/disconnected) or any fatal errors from
the transcoding process. Here is an example of a fatal error:

```bash
Transcode error from ewr-prod-livepeer-orchestrator-0 for segment 0:
**Unsupported input pixel format**
```

If you run into this or any similar errors, check the configuration in your
streaming software (e.g., OBS) and restart the stream.

### Session Ingest Rate

Session ingest rate tells you the bitrate of the video received by Livepeer
ingest servers, updated every 10 seconds. A high bitrate is suggestive that
streams into the Livepeer system are high quality, your encoder is working
correctly, and your internet connection is good. A fluctuating or low bitrate
may suggest that your encoder is misconfigured or that the streamer internet
connection isn't as strong as it should be to deliver high-quality streams to
your viewers.

### Monitoring in the Dashboard

In the dashboard, there will be a `health` tab on the right side:

</Frame>
During any Active stream, components on this page will display a variety of health
indicators.

At the bottom of the page, a chart will show the ingest rate of a livestream:
