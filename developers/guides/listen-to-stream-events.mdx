Livepeer Studio uses webhooks to communicate with your application
asynchronously when events for your stream occur. For example, you may want to
know when a stream is `active` or `idle`, so that you can surface this
information to viewers.

When these events happen, you can configure Studio to make a `POST` request to a webhook URL that you specify.

### Type of stream events

|                            |                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stream.started`           | The parent stream object's isActive value is marked as true and the .m3u8 HLS URL works                                                                                |
| `stream.idle`              | The parent stream object's isActive value should be marked as false and the .m3u8 HLS URL no longer works                                                              |
| `recording.ready`          | This fires when a recording is ready to be downloaded                                                                                                                  |
| `recording.started`        | This fires when recording has started on an active stream                                                                                                              |
| `recording.waiting`        | This fires after a stream with recording on has concluded and is not yet ready to be downloaded. Typically it takes 5 minutes for recordings to be ready for download. |
| `multistream.connected`    | This fires when we've successfully connected to the multistream target                                                                                                 |
| `multistream.error`        | This fires when we've encountered an error either while attempting to connect to the third party streaming service or while broadcasting.                              |
| `multistream.disconnected` | This fires when we are no longer sending video to the multistream target.                                                                                              |

### Set up a webhook endpoint

The first step is to set up a webhook endpoint in your application. This is the URL that Livepeer Studio will send the event to. Learn more about [setting up a webhook endpoint](/developers/guides/setup-and-listen-to-webhooks).

### Add a webhook URL to Livepeer Studio

Log in to the [Livepeer Studio](https://studio.livepeer.org/) and navigate to the [Developers/Webhooks](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/webhooks) page.
