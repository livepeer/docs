description: "Learn how to check out viewer engagement on Livepeer"
---

Livepeer offers detailed information on viewer behavior and playback quality on
your platform. The API includes engagement metrics such as view counts and watch
time, as well as performance metrics such as error rate, time to first frame,
rebuffer ratio, and exit-before-starts across a variety of dimensions.

### Realtime Viewership

This API includes realtime metrics about the ongoing livestream or VOD engagement:

- Viewer Count: The number of viewers currently watching the stream (or VOD).
- Error Rate: This metric helps to understand the number of errors that viewers are
  experiencing while watching the stream (or VOD).

### Usage Metrics

This API includes usage metrics to help you understand how viewers are
engaging with your platform:

- Number of Views: This metric gives you a comprehensive view of the total
  number of views across your platform. We colloquially define a view as “play
  intent”, which means the video either played, stalled, or encountered an
  error.
- Minutes of Watch Time: Measure the total amount of time viewers spend on your
  platform, so you can track engagement and identify areas for improvement.

<Info>
  Please note that data is refreshed every 5 minutes and newly uploaded videos
  may take up to an hour before viewership data is available
</Info>

### Performance Metrics

This API offers several key performance metrics to help you understand your
platforms performance:

- Error Rate: Percentage of views that encountered an error.
- Time to First Frame (TTFF): Measures the time in milliseconds it takes between
  the player requesting video and the first frame being ready to play.
- Rebuffer Ratio: Percentage of time a viewer spends experiencing rebuffering
  during playback.
- Exit Before Starts: Percentage of views that are abandoned before the video
  begins to play, potentially indicating issues with playback.

<Info>
  Please note that data is refreshed every 5 minutes and newly uploaded videos
  may take up to an hour before viewership data is available
</Info>

### Dimensions

To provide a comprehensive view of viewer behavior, our data product includes
several dimensions to help you segment your data and identify patterns:

- Video: View metrics for individual videos, queryable by playback ID or by
  dStorage ID’s, such as CID.
- Browser: Understand how different browsers impact viewer behavior and
  performance, so you can optimize your platform for each browser type.
- Device: Understand how different devices impact viewer behavior, so you can
  optimize your platform for each device type.
- OS: Understand how different operating systems impact viewer behavior, so you
  can optimize your platform for each OS.
- Continent, Country, and Subdivisions: Segment your data by location to
  identify regional trends and tailor your platform to local preferences.
- Time Zone: Measure viewer behavior across different time zones, so you can
  optimize your platform for peak usage times.
- Time: Analyze viewer behavior across different time periods (hour, day, week,
  month, year, all-time) to identify trends.

## Registering views

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Livepeer Player">

To collect and register viewership metrics, you first need to configure your
player. We recommend that you use the [Livepeer player](/sdks/react/player/Root)
to get viewership metrics, as it comes fully configured. You can follow the
Player guide to get started.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Player">

We also support viewership metrics for applications using custom players. In
order for metrics to be tracked by Livepeer, you will need to configure your
player using `addMediaMetrics`.

Here's how to configure your player:

<Tabs >
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

<Warning>
  Make sure you have initialized your player before calling `addMediaMetrics`.
</Warning>

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from "@livepeer/core-web/browser";

const video = document.getElementById("my-video");

const { destroy } = addMediaMetrics(ref.current);

// or, you can *optionally* pass options to the addMediaMetrics function
const { destroy } = addMediaMetrics(ref.current, {
  // specify the source URL of the video, which should include a playbackId.
  // this should only be used when using a custom video player that sets a `blob:...` URL or no `src` on the video element.
  src: "https://livepeercdn.studio/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8",
  // specify a unique viewer ID for tracking purposes
  viewerId: "user123",
  // monitor when the metrics fails to report
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error("Metrics collection error:", error);
  },
});
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React">

<Warning>
  Make sure you have initialized your player before calling `addMediaMetrics`.
</Warning>

```tsx
import { addMediaMetrics } from "@livepeer/core-web/media/browser";
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

const source = "https://livepeercdn.studio/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8";

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const { destroy } = addMediaMetrics(ref.current, {
      // specify the source URL of the video, which should include a playbackId.
      // this should only be used when using a custom video player that sets a `blob:...` URL or no `src` on the video element.
      src: source,
      // specify a unique viewer ID for tracking purposes
      viewerId: "user123",
      // monitor when the metrics fails to report
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error("Metrics collection error:", error);
      },
    });
    return () => destroy();
  }, []);

  return (
    <video
      controls
      ref={ref}
      src={source}
      style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "500px" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Retrieving views from the Dashboard

The Livepeer Studio Dashboard is a frontend interface for publishing live or
on-demand video streams with no code. In this guide, we'll show you how to use
the dashboard to retrieve viewership metrics.

### Navigate to the assets page

<Frame>![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-1.png)</Frame>

### Click on an existing asset

Click on an existing asset and you'll be brought to that asset's specific
details page. If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/developers/guides/upload-video-asset).

<Frame>![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-4.png)</Frame>
### View your asset's viewership metrics

In the asset's specific detail page you can view its total number of views.

<Frame>![Asset views](/images/engagement/Dashboard-10.png)</Frame>
## Retrieving views from the API

### Get the `playbackId` of an existing stream/asset

Get the `playbackId` of an existing asset. A `playbackId` can be found in the
stream/asset page on the dashboard or from any Asset API call. If you haven't created
an stream/asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/developers/guides/upload-video-asset).

<Info>
  The `playbackId` can be a canonical playback ID from a specific Livepeer asset
  or stream objects, or dStorage identifiers for assets. Queries by dStorage ID
  are universal/cross-account, as explained below, so check what makes the most
  sense for your app.
</Info>

When querying by dStorage ID (e.g. `ipfs://` or `ar://` URLs, or CID/txID), you
will get views for all assets with that dStorage ID across any Livepeer account.
This is useful to display global metrics from a video. To display the viewership
metrics only from the videos in your account, use the API objects `playbackId`.

### Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `playbackId`, you can make a request to get the viewership
data.

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/query/total/{playbackId} \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

<Info>
For more information on the API and SDK methods, refer to the
[API reference](/api-reference/viewership/get-public-total-views).
</Info>

### Diving deeper

If you're happy with the above metrics you can stop here. If you want to build
more advanced analytics, you can use the following API endpoints to get more
detailed data.

#### [Realtime Viewership API](/api-reference/viewership/get-realtime-viewership)

This API can be called from the frontend to retrieve realtime engagement metrics
(current view count and error rate). You can break down the results by playback id,
browser, device, and country.

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/now?playbackId=playback_id&breakdownBy%5B%5D=browser' \
  --header 'Authorization Bearer <token>'
```

<Info>
For more information on the API and SDK methods, refer to the
[API reference](/api-reference/viewership/get-realtime-viewership).
</Info>

#### [Creator metrics API](/api-reference/viewership/get-creators-metrics)

This API can be called from the frontend to retrieve detailed engagement metrics
for a specific resource. The only restriction it has is that it has to be called
with an `assetId` or `streamId` values, which are private values today that only
the asset creator should have access. Soon this creator ownership will be
validated using wallet signatures instead.

The idea for this API is to build creator analytics dashboards. It can be called
from the frontend and can provide detailed insights to creators about their
assets and streams.

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/query/creator?from=from&to=to&timeStep=day&assetId=asset_id_here&breakdownBy%5B%5D=browser' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

```

<Info>
For more information on the API and SDK methods, refer to the
[API reference](/api-reference/viewership/get-creators-metrics).
</Info>

#### [All metrics API](/api-reference/viewership/get-usage-metrics)

This API can be called from the backend to retrieve detailed engagement metrics
for a specific resource. It requires a non-CORS API key to be used, meaning that
it cannot be called from the frontend. This is for security reasons since this
API provides full access to all metrics in the account, meaning it provides the
most flexibility in queries.

The idea is that developers should build their own abstraction and access
control logics on top of this API and abstract it as higher level API in their
apps.

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/usage/query?timeStep=hour&breakdownBy%5B%5D=creatorId&from=from&to=to' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

<Info>
For more information on the API and SDK methods, refer to the
[API reference](/api-reference/viewership/get-usage-metrics).
