description: "Learn how to check out viewer engagement on Livepeer"
---

Livepeer offers detailed information on viewer behavior and playback quality on your platform. The API includes engagement metrics such as view counts and watch time, as well as performance metrics such as error rate, time to first frame, rebuffer ratio, and exit-before-starts across a variety of dimensions.

### Usage Metrics

This API also includes usage metrics to help you understand how viewers are engaging with your platform:

- Number of Views: This metric gives you a comprehensive view of the total number of views across your platform. We colloquially define a view as “play intent”, which means the video either played, stalled, or encountered an error.
- Minutes of Watch Time: Measure the total amount of time viewers spend on your platform, so you can track engagement and identify areas for improvement.

### Performance Metrics

This API offers several key performance metrics to help you understand your platforms performance:

- Error Rate: Percentage of views that encountered an error.
- Time to First Frame (TTFF): Measures the time in milliseconds it takes between the player requesting video and the first frame being ready to play.
- Rebuffer Ratio: Percentage of time a viewer spends experiencing rebuffering during playback.
- Exit Before Starts: Percentage of views that are abandoned before the video begins to play, potentially indicating issues with playback.

### Dimensions

To provide a comprehensive view of viewer behavior, our data product includes several dimensions to help you segment your data and identify patterns:

- Video: View metrics for individual videos, queryable by playback ID or by dStorage ID’s, such as CID.
- Browser: Understand how different browsers impact viewer behavior and performance, so you can optimize your platform for each browser type.
- Device: Understand how different devices impact viewer behavior, so you can optimize your platform for each device type.
- OS: Understand how different operating systems impact viewer behavior, so you can optimize your platform for each OS.
- Continent, Country, and Subdivisions: Segment your data by location to identify regional trends and tailor your platform to local preferences.
- Time Zone: Measure viewer behavior across different time zones, so you can optimize your platform for peak usage times.
- Time: Analyze viewer behavior across different time periods (hour, day, week, month, year, all-time) to identify trends.

<Info>
  Please note that data is refreshed every 5 minutes and newly uploaded videos
  may take up to an hour before viewership data is available

## Registering views

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Livepeer Player">

To collect and register viewership metrics, you first need to configure your player.
We recommend that you use the [Livepeer player](/sdks/livepeer-js/Player)
to get viewership metrics, as it comes fully configured.
You can follow the Player guide to get started.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Player">

We also support viewership metrics for applications using custom players.
In order for metrics to be tracked by Livepeer, you will need to configure
your player using `addMediaMetrics`.

Here's how to configure your player:

<Tabs >
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from "livepeer/media/browser";

const source =
  "https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8";
const video = document.getElementById("my-video");

// set up your player before calling addMediaMetrics

addMediaMetrics(video, source, (e) => console.error("Error adding metrics", e));
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React">

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from "livepeer/media/browser";
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [source, setSource] = useState(
    "https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8"
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      // set up other stuff in your player before calling addMediaMetrics
      const metrics = addMediaMetrics(videoRef.current, source, (e) =>
        console.error("Error adding metrics", e)
      );
      return metrics?.destroy;
    }
  }, [videoRef, source]);

  return (
    <video
      controls
      ref={videoRef}
      src={source}
      style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "500px" }}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Retrieving views from the Dashboard

The Livepeer Studio Dashboard is a frontend interface for publishing live or
on-demand video streams with no code. In this guide, we'll show you how to use
the dashboard to retrieve viewership metrics.

### Navigate to the Assets page

<Frame>![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-1.png)</Frame>

### Click on an existing asset

Click on an existing asset and you'll be brought to that asset's specific
details page. If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](developers/guides/upload-video-asset).

<Frame>![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-4.png)</Frame>
### View your asset's viewership metrics

In the asset's specific detail page you can view its total number of views.

<Frame>![Asset views](/images/engagement/Dashboard-10.png)</Frame>
## Retrieving views from the API

### Get the `playbackId` of an existing asset

Get the `playbackId` of an existing asset. A `playbackId` can be found in the
asset page on the dashboard or from any Asset API call. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the [upload a video asset
guide](developers/guides/upload-video-asset).

<Info>
  The `playbackId` can be a canonical playback ID from a specific Livepeer asset
  or stream objects, or dStorage identifiers for assets. Queries by dStorage ID
  are universal/cross-account, as explained below, so check what makes the most
  sense for your app.
</Info>

When querying by dStorage ID (e.g. `ipfs://` or `ar://` URLs, or CID/txID), you
will get views for all assets with that dStorage ID across any Livepeer account.
This is useful to display global metrics from a video. To display the viewership
metrics only from the videos in your account, use the API objects `playbackId`.

### Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `playbackId`, you can make a request to get the viewership
data.

    import { Livepeer } from "livepeer";

    const apiToken = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'; // Replace with your API token

    const livepeer = new Livepeer(apiToken);

### Diving deeper

If you're happy with the above metrics you can stop here. If you want to build
more advanced analytics, you can use the following API endpoints to get more
detailed data.

#### [Creator metrics API](/api-reference/viewership/get-creators-metrics)

This API can be called from the frontend to retrieve detailed engagement metrics
for a specific resource. The only restriction it has is that it has to be called
with an `assetId` or `streamId` values, which are private values today that only
the asset creator should have access. Soon this creator ownership will be
validated using wallet signatures instead.

The idea for this API is to build creator analytics dashboards. It can be called
from the frontend and can provide detailed insights to creators about their
assets and streams.

#### [All metrics API](/api-reference/viewership/get-usage-metrics)

This API can be called from the backend to retrieve detailed engagement metrics
for a specific resource. It requires a non-CORS API key to be used, meaning that
it cannot be called from the frontend. This is for security reasons since this
API provides full access to all metrics in the account, meaning it provides the
most flexibility in queries.

The idea is that developers should build their own abstraction and access
control logics on top of this API and abstract it as higher level API in their
apps.

We have put together a tutorial complete with templates to get you started.
