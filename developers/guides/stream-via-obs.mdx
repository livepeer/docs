---

The purpose of this guide is to allow you to get a more in-depth look at setting
up a livestream using Livepeer Studio with OBS. In order to broadcast a live
stream, the content creator will need a stream key.

## Introduction

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is an application that many creators use to stream into Livepeer
because it is easy to use, open source, and offers a high degree of customization.

## Create a stream

Follow our previous guide on [creating a stream](/developers/guides/create-livestream) to get a stream key to provide to the creator on your platform.
They will need to use this for their OBS configuration.

## Open OBS and create source

The creator will then need to:

1. Click the **+ icon** under sources and select **Video Capture Device** if
   you’d like to stream using a camera or webcam. If you’d like to stream a
   browser window, select **Window Capture**.
2. Give the device a name:

<br />
<Frame>![OBS2](/images/obs/OBS2.png) </Frame>
<br />
<Frame>![OBS3](/images/obs/OBS3.png)</Frame>

## Update stream settings

1. Select **Stream** settings.
2. Select **Show All...** and then **Livepeer Studio** for the service.
3. Keep the **Default** Server and paste the **Stream Key** provided by Livepeer Studio into
   the OBS **“Stream Key”** fields. It is highly recommended to not ignore the streaming service
   recommendations. If you choose to do this, please see the
   [low latency](#configuring-obs-for-low-latency) section below.

## Stream and play back

After they save their settings, OBS will return to the stream console.

Press start streaming (from the output they selected when inputting your stream settings above).
Any player will now be able to [play back the livestream](/developers/guides/playback-a-livestream) with the playback ID.

## Configuring OBS for Low Latency

### Balancing Low Latency with User Experience

Achieving the right balance between low latency and stream quality is essential for providing the best possible user experience.
Two settings that significantly impact your stream quality, latency, and user experience are:

- **Rate Control:** This setting dictates the bitrate or "quality" of the stream. A high amount of bandwidth usually means better
  quality, but keep in mind that your output can never improve the quality of your stream beyond your input.
- **Keyframe Interval:** Video streams consist of full frames and data relative to the full frames. This setting determines how often
  a full frame appears, which heavily influences latency.

#### Optimizing for Low Latency

Low latency is primarily determined by the _keyframe interval_. Having keyframes appear more frequently allows viewers to "hook
onto" a point closer to the actual live point. However, full frames can't (re)use references to other frames, so more bandwidth
is needed to generate a stream of the same quality compared to one with a lower number of keyframes.

<Info>
  We also require that the user turns off B-frames for lowest latency. B-frames,
  or bidirectional frames, are a type of video frame that makes use of
  references from the past as well as the future. They improve video compression
  by having more context, but also increase latency because they require a
  bigger encode buffer. Furthermore, in WebRTC video playback, B-frames will
  appear out-of-order on most systems.
</Info>

#### Optimizing for Stream Quality and User Experience

Stream quality and user experience are mainly decided by the rate control of the stream. When optimizing for user experience,
consider the stability of the video playback and the smoothness of the video. This is mostly decided by the peak bitrate of
the video. A high peak bitrate can cause playback problems like buffering or skips in video playback for some viewers.

#### Livepeer-specific considerations

Since Livepeer is mostly HLS-based, a 2-second keyframe interval is generally encouraged, as HLS has a minimum latency of around 3-5
keyframe intervals. This choice would prioritize low latency.

However, if the connection is fairly poor, a 5-second keyframe interval will allow for higher quality per bit at the expense
of more latency. If quality is valued over latency, this is a better choice, and you could even consider going for longer
intervals. It is essential to understand the impact of each setting and adapt them to your specific requirements and priorities.
The optimal stream settings may vary depending on your specific requirements.

### Recommended OBS Settings

The following profiles provide a good starting point for balancing low latency with stream quality and user experience.
You may need to adjust the settings to suit your specific situation.

#### Low latency, high quality

This profile prioritizes low latency, but still maintains a good quality at the cost of more (and more unpredictably spiking) bandwidth.

```txt
Rate Control: CRF
CRF: 25
Keyframe Interval: 1
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
x264 options: bframes=0
Resolution: 1080p
```

#### Low latency for bad connections

This profile prioritizes low latency, sacrificing quality to maintain a low bit rate so that even those with bad connections can watch reliably.

```txt
Rate Control: CBR
Bit Rate: 1200
Keyframe Interval: 1
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
x264 options: bframes=0
Resolution: 720p
```

#### Balanced high quality

A good balance between reasonable latency and reasonable bit rate, but with consistently high quality.

```txt
Rate Control: CRF
CRF: 25
Keyframe Interval: 2
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
No additional x264 options
Resolution: Any
```

#### Balanced for bad connections

A good balance between reasonable latency and reasonable quality, but with a consistent bit rate that should be comfortably viewable for most modern internet connections.

```txt
Rate Control: CBR
Bit Rate: 2000
Keyframe Interval: 2
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
No additional x264 options
Resolution: Up to 1080p
```

#### High quality, high latency

This profile prioritizes quality over everything else, sacrificing latency to keep the bit rate within reasonable bounds.

```txt
Rate Control: CRF
CRF: 27
Keyframe Interval: 10
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
x264 options: bframes=3
Resolution: 1080p
```

#### Low bandwidth, high latency

This profile prioritizes watchability, even for really bad connections, sacrificing both quality and latency to do so.

```txt
Rate Control: CBR
Bit Rate: 700
Keyframe Interval: 10
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
x264 options: bframes=3
Resolution: 720p or lower
```
