In this guide, we demonstrate how to embed an asset in your application using a
hosted version of the Livepeer Player.

<Warning>
  If you are using React, consider using Livepeer UI Kit instead.
</Warning>

This is one of the easiest ways to play back a video on your website. You can
embed the player by using the below code snippet.

You can replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your video's playback id.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv?v={PLAYBACK_ID}"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>
```

## Configs

See the livestream embed docs for how to set up low latency, clipping, and other
configs for streams.

You can override the default `muted` and `autoplay` behavior with `&muted=false`
and/or `&autoplay=false`. These are set to true by default. Looping can also be
set with `&loop=true`.

<iframe
