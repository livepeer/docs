Livepeer API uses API keys to verify and authorize requests. You can manage and review your API keys through Livepeer Studio. You need to pass your API key in the `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` prefix while sending a request.

```
Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

It's important to note that your API keys come with significant privileges, so it's essential to keep them safe and secure! Refrain from sharing your secret API keys in GitHub or other publicly accessible places.

By default, API keys can only be used from a backend server. This is to ensure maximum security and prevent that you accidentally expose your account by including the secret API key in a public web page.

### CORS-Enabled Keys

<Warning>
  Please read the below documentation in its entirety before using CORS-enabled
  API keys. **There is a different security model for CORS keys.**
</Warning>

Studio supports the creation of CORS-enabled API keys. This is a special option when generating an API key which allows a webpage to make requests **directly**
to Studio, as opposed to coming from your backend.

#### Security with CORS Keys

**The security model is different for CORS-enabled API keys.** Since any user has access to these keys, the IDs of assets and streams **must** be kept
secret from anyone who should not have admin control over them. For instance, a viewer should only have access to the playback ID, since
knowing the asset ID (together with the CORS-enabled API key, which is embedded in the webpage) allows them to make changes to the asset.

This is the same for streams - if a user has access to a stream ID alongside the CORS API key, they can modify the stream or view the stream key.
If a viewer had access to the stream ID + CORS API key, they could hijack the stream. **A `playbackId` should be exposed to the viewer only.**
