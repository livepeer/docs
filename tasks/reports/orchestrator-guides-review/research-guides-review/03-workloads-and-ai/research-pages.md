  - extracted: Except for the pipeline — which uses a separate Ollama based runner — all batch pipelines use this image.
  - extracted: aiModels.json — full reference is the single file that controls everything about your AI worker: which pipelines you run, which models you load, whether they stay warm in VRAM, and how you price each job.

- `v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/realtime-ai-setup.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Instead of processing a discrete request and returning a result, your node continuously transforms live video — receiving frames from a WebRTC stream, running inference on each frame, and streaming processed frames back with sub 100ms latency.
  - extracted: This is the Cascade architecture: the pipeline that powers live AI video effects, live style transfer, and streaming AI agents on the Livepeer network.
  - extracted: What Cascade is Cascade is Livepeer's live video AI processing pipeline.

  - claim families: none
  - extracted: How transcoding works When a broadcaster sends a live stream to a Livepeer gateway, the gateway segments the stream into roughly 2 second chunks and routes each segment to an orchestrator.
  - extracted: You set your price with the flag; by default is 1, meaning you charge in wei per individual output pixel.
  - extracted: This charges 500 wei per output pixel.

## Verified Claims

- `orch-price-ceiling-filtering` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Gateways filter orchestrators by price ceilings before routing work. Competitive hardware alone is not enough if operator pricing exceeds gateway maxima.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/monitoring-and-tooling/troubleshooting.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms
- `orch-ot-split-capacity-sum` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/orchestrator-transcoder-setup.mdx`
  - summary: O-T split docs should keep the capacity model aligned: orchestrator session capacity is the sum of connected transcoder `-maxSessions` values, and protocol management remains separate from GPU workload processing.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/orchestrator-transcoder-setup.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 8 matched terms
- `orch-pool-worker-offchain-payouts` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Pool-worker guidance should stay explicit that a worker is not running an orchestrator identity, does not perform on-chain operations, and receives off-chain payouts from the pool operator rather than protocol-level reward flows.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/join-a-pool.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms

## Conflicted Claims

- `orch-batch-ai-vram-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Docs disagree on the practical VRAM minimum for batch AI and real-time AI workloads. Hardware and setup pages should not present conflicting minimums as equally current.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/rcs-requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms; current-language match 13
- `orch-ai-routing-capability-based` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx`
  - summary: AI jobs are routed primarily by capability match and price ceilings rather than by stake weight. Docs should not collapse AI routing into the same rules as transcoding routing.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-active-set-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Solo transcoding guidance repeatedly states that operators need enough bonded LPT to enter the active set, often phrased as top 100, but that wording is time-sensitive and should not be treated as durable fact without current evidence.
  - primary evidence: official-page → https://explorer.livepeer.org/orchestrators
  - evidence why: source priority 100
- `orch-pool-vs-solo-prerequisites` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Pool workers and solo operators have different prerequisites. Pages should not imply that LPT, ETH, or public service exposure are universal requirements for every orchestrator entry path.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/join-a-pool.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-siphon-github-current` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Split-setup guidance depends on OrchestratorSiphon still being an active community-maintained project. That claim should be checked against the current GitHub repository, not just repeated in docs.
  - primary evidence: github-repo → https://github.com/Stronk-Tech/OrchestratorSiphon
  - evidence why: source priority 60; 4 matched terms; recency 56d; state active
- `orch-siphon-reward-isolation` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx`
  - summary: A split setup with OrchestratorSiphon isolates the keystore from the GPU machine and keeps reward calling independent of GPU uptime. Docs should keep that claim aligned across setup-path pages.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 11 matched terms

## Time-Sensitive Claims

- `orch-consumer-nvenc-session-cap` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Consumer NVIDIA NVENC session-cap guidance is factual but volatile. Hardware requirement and transcoding guides should stay aligned on whether GeForce-class cards are typically capped at 2-3 concurrent sessions and whether newer generations changed that default.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-commercial-model-warmth` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx`
  - summary: Commercial AI operator guidance should keep warm-model, pre-loaded startup, and cold-start SLA language aligned across setup and business-case pages. These claims describe real operational expectations, but they remain experimental and workload-sensitive.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-session-limit-default` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: The default session limit and overload behavior are operational facts that multiple setup and hardware pages depend on. When docs state the default cap or the error condition, they should stay aligned with current go-livepeer behavior.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 6 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-bandwidth-per-stream-planning` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Bandwidth planning for transcoding is currently presented as an approximate planning rule rather than a single durable network constant. Pages should make the source-resolution assumption and rendition-set basis explicit when quoting per-stream bandwidth.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 2 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-reward-profitability-threshold` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx`
  - summary: Reward-call profitability guidance should remain explicitly time-sensitive because gas cost, ETH price, and LPT price move. Docs must not present rough thresholds as durable constants.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
