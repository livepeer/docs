title: Get Started
---

It's fantastic to see interest in contributing to the Livepeer AI Network! There
are many ways to contribute, and excitement is high to build a decentralized AI
ecosystem together ❤️. Here are a few ways to get started:

- **Orchestrators**: With GPUs that have at least 16GB of VRAM, contribution is
  possible by setting up an AI Orchestrator node and processing AI tasks on the
  Livepeer AI Network. Check out the
  [Orchestrator Setup Guide](/ai/orchestrators/get-started) page to learn more.
- **Gateways**: Server hardware can be used to connect customers to the Livepeer AI
  Network by setting up an AI Gateway node. Check out the
  [Set up AI Gateway](/ai/gateways/setup-gateway) page to learn more.
- **Founder**: Founders can contribute by building AI applications on the Livepeer AI
  Network. Check out the [Build on the Livepeer AI Network](/ai/builders) page to learn
  more.
- **Developers**: Open Source Developers can contribute by improving the Livepeer AI
  Network codebase. Check out the guide on
  [Contributing to the Livepeer AI Network](/ai/contribute-to-ai-subnet) to learn more.

For any questions or help needed, reach out in the `ai-video` channel of the
[Livepeer Discord](https://discord.gg/7w2R6v). Support is available to help get
started and along the way. Let's build together! 🚀
