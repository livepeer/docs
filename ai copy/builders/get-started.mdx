title: Building on the Livepeer AI Network
---

The Livepeer AI Network, currently in its **Alpha** stage, is fully operational and
already hosts several quality applications. At this stage, efforts are concentrated on
**network optimization** and **user experience enhancement**. While official
SDKs are still under development, developers can interact directly with the Livepeer AI
Network using the endpoints exposed by Livepeer network Gateway nodes. For a
comprehensive understanding of the Livepeer AI Network endpoints and to experiment with
the API, please refer to the
[Livepeer AI Network API Reference](/ai/api-reference/text-to-image).
