<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
  To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:

    - [Create an API key](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/api-keys)

  </Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK">

Get the Livepeer Python SDK.

```bash
pip install livepeer
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    
The first step is to initialize the SDK with your Livepeer Studio API key.

```python
import livepeer
from livepeer.models import operations

lpClient = livepeer.SDK(
    api_key="", # Your API key
)
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the SDK">
    Now that you have the SDK installed and initialized, you can use it in your app.
Let's create a stream.

```python
import livepeer
from livepeer.models import components

lpClient = livepeer.SDK(
    api_key="",
)

req = components.NewStreamPayload(
    name='test_stream'
)

res = lpClient.stream.create(req)

if res.data is not None:
    # handle response
    pass
```

  </Step>

</Steps>
