<Warning>
  We're aware that some API requests through the SDKs are not working as
  expected. We're working on a fix and will update the documentation once it's
  resolved. In the meantime, please use the REST API directly.
</Warning>

## Server-side SDKs

Server-side SDKs reduce the amount of work required to use the Livepeer REST
API. Install a language-specific SDK into your application, initialize with your
API key and get started with just 2 lines of code.
