---

The `Player` component provides an easy way to display video or audio.

It automatically handles different source types from a Livepeer provider, such as WebRTC, MP4, and HLS.
These are seamlessly integrated so that playback has low latency under all network conditions.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">

    ```tsx
    import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
    ```

The following example assumes a stream or asset was created via `useCreateAsset` or `useCreateStream`, and the `playbackId`
was passed to the viewer.

    ```tsx
    import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
    import Image from 'next/image';

    import blenderPoster from '../../../public/images/blender-poster.png';

    const PosterImage = () => {
      return (
        <Image
          src={blenderPoster}
          layout="fill"
          objectFit="cover"
          priority
          placeholder="blur"
        />
      );
    };

    function PlayerComponent() {
      return (
        <Player
          title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
          playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
          poster={<PosterImage />}
          showPipButton
          objectFit="cover"
          priority
        />
      );
    };
    ```

Here we also introduce a custom `PosterImage` React component, which is described in
more detail below in [`poster`](#poster) configuration.

<br />

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    ```tsx 
    import { Player } from '@livepeer/react-native';
    ```

The following example assumes a stream or asset was created via `useCreateAsset` or `useCreateStream`, and the `playbackId`
was passed to the viewer.

    ```tsx
    import { Player } from '@livepeer/react-native';

    import blenderPoster from './assets/images/blender-poster.png';

## Configuration

### playbackId or src

A `playbackId` for an [Asset](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/core/src/types/provider.ts) or
[Stream](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/core/src/types/provider.ts), or `src`, a media source URL. One of these is
required.

#### playbackId

<INfo>
  If a playback ID is provided, the playback URL corresponding to the playback
  ID will be automatically fetched.
</INfo>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
    />
  );
}
```

The `playbackId` passed to the `Player` can be either a short playback ID
which is created on asset/stream creation, or, for an asset, an IPFS CID. If
the provided IPFS CID or IPFS/Arweave URL has not been uploaded yet, it can be auto-uploaded and
played back - see [`autoUrlUpload`](#autourlupload) for more details.

```tsx
// only after the asset has been persisted to IPFS
// equivalent to the above example
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="bafybeida3w2w7fch2fy6rfvfttqamlcyxgd3ddbf4u25n7fxzvyvcaegxy"
    />
  );
}
```

#### src

<Warning>
  Using an arbitrary `src` that is not from a provider will not be transcoded
  (unless [`autoUrlUpload`](#autourlupload) is used), and will take up
  significant network bandwidth. It's highly recommended to upload media to a
  provider, and serve content to viewers with a `playbackId`.
</Warning>

The Player also supports an arbitrary `src` URL which can correspond to any common video or audio which most browsers support.
See [caniuse video format](https://caniuse.com/?search=video%20format) for more details on browser support.

<Warning>
  Metrics reporting **will not work** with an arbitrary `src` (e.g. not a Studio
  playback URL).
</Warning>

If the `src` is an IPFS/Arweave URL, it can be auto-uploaded and played back - see [`autoUrlUpload`](#autourlupload) for
more details.

```tsx
const src =
  "https://ipfs.livepeer.studio/ipfs/QmURv3J5BGsz23GaCUm7oXncm2M9SCj8RQDuFPGzAFSJw8";

function PlayerComponent() {
  return <Player src={src} />;
}
```

### jwt or accessKey

<Info>
  This section defines ways to play back a video which has a playback policy
  applied to it. Your application can prevent playback unless the user meets
  application-specific requirements (this can be done either with JWTs or
  webhooks, and solves use-cases like restricting viewership to users who own an
  NFT, have created an account on your platform, are part of a multisig, etc).
</Info>

#### jwt

The JSON Web Token (JWT) used to access media gated by a `jwt` playback policy.
Alternatively, `accessKey` can be used for a `webhook` playback policy.
See the [Access Control example](/developers/guides/access-control-vod) for more details.

<Tip>Access control is now supported for both streams and assets!</Tip>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      jwt={jwt}
    />
  );
}
```

#### accessKey

The access key used to access media behind a `webhook` playback policy.
Alternatively, `onAccessKeyRequest` can be used to return this access key in a callback.
See the [Access Control example](/developers/guides/access-control-vod) for more details.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      accessKey="access-key"
    />
  );
}
```

#### onAccessKeyRequest

A callback which returns the access key used to gate access to media. Similar to `accessKey` above,
this is used to gate content based on a `webhook` playback policy. This is used instead of the `accessKey` prop, and can
be asynchronous and accepts any Promise or simple callback which returns a string.
See the [Access Control example](/developers/guides/access-control-vod) for more details.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      onAccessKeyRequest={async () => {
        return "access-key";
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### priority

When true, the media will be considered high priority and preload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for media using `priority`.
You should use the priority property on any media detected as the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/) element.
It may be appropriate to have multiple, as different content may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.

Should only be used when the media is visible above the fold. Defaults to false.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      priority
    />
  );
}
```

### lowLatency

When enabled, the Player will play back livestreams with low-latency WebRTC. If this does not succeed in
playing back (commonly due to a slow network or connectivity issues), the Player
will automatically fall back to HLS playback. Also, if the stream contains B-frames, or bidirectional frames,
(which are common for users streaming with OBS or other streaming apps), the Player will automatically fall
back, so that out-of-order frames are not displayed.

<Warning>
  OBS users should be instructed to use the Livepeer stream profile, or to
  manually turn off B-frames in their stream. See our [Stream from
  OBS](/developers/guides/stream-via-obs) docs for more information.
</Warning>

This only applies to video elements which are playing back livestreams - assets will play back with MP4 or HLS.
Defaults to `false`.

You may also specify `"force"`, which forces WebRTC and disables fallback to HLS. This is not a recommended default unless
your application requires low latency (and should not play if low latency is not available),
due to the possible connectivity issues which WebRTC can face, which HLS is not subject to.

<Info>
  We are planning on adding similar functionality to the React Native `Player` -
  please reach out on Discord if you are interested.
</Info>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player title="My Livestream" playbackId="wwl88k4g8f5eese9" lowLatency />
  );
}
```

### title

The `title` for the content. This is highly recommended, since it is used for [accessibility labels](https://web.dev/semantics-aria/)
in the Player. If you do not want to show the title visually, see [`showTitle`](#showtitle).

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
    />
  );
}
```

### showTitle

Enables/disables the title component.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      showTitle={false}
    />
  );
}
```

### aspectRatio

Sets the aspect ratio for the content. Highly recommended for a great viewing experience (for more information, see
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)). Defaults to `16to9`.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      aspectRatio="1to1"
    />
  );
}
```

### loop

Sets whether the content will loop when finished. Defaults to `false`.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      loop
    />
  );
}
```

### poster

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">

Sets the poster image. This can be either a string for an image URL, or a React component.

The `poster` can be a simple image URL, and it will be rendered with a regular `img` HTML tag.

<Wraning>
  It is recommended to use an optimized React image component for this (see
  below), as opposed to passing a simple URL.
</Wraning>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      poster="/images/blender-poster.png"
    />
  );
}
```

If the poster is a React component, it will be rendered with similar CSS attributes to the `img` above. In the below example,
we show the use of [Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) to render an optimized
image, which will automatically handle slow network conditions/different device sizes.

```tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";
import Image from "next/image";

import blenderPoster from "./images/blender-poster.png";

const PosterImage = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={blenderPoster}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      poster={<PosterImage />}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">

Sets the poster image. This can be either a remote URL or a local file resource.

<Warning>
  It is recommended to use a local file resource, as opposed to passing a remote
  URL. Since this image is used during a loading state, it will ensure a smooth
  experience for users.
</Warning>

```tsx
import posterImage from "./images/blender-poster.png";

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      poster={posterImage}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### showLoadingSpinner

Shows/hides the loading spinner for the media content. Defaults to `true`.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      showLoadingSpinner={false}
    />
  );
}
```

### controls

Configures the timeout for autohiding controls, default volume, and (only on web) if keyboard hotkeys for controlling video are enabled.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      controls={{ autohide: 0, hotkeys: false, defaultVolume: 0.6 }}
    />
  );
}
```

### autoPlay and muted

Sets the video to autoplay when the content comes into focus on the webpage. If `autoPlay` is specified, `muted` will
be forced to be `true`. This is [enforced in many modern browsers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/).

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      muted
      autoPlay
    />
  );
}
```

### objectFit

Sets the video's [object fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property. Defaults to `contain`.
`cover` is usually used when there is a guarantee that the `aspectRatio` matches the content displayed in the Player.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      aspectRatio="1to1"
      objectFit="cover"
    />
  );
}
```

### showPipButton

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">

Shows the Picture-in-Picture button to the left of the fullscreen button. Defaults to `false`.
See [children](#children) for an example on how to use the underlying `<PictureInPictureButton />`.

<Info>
  We support both the [w3c](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) standard
  (which most modern browsers support), as well as the [older Safari/iOS
  spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/adding_picture_in_picture_to_your_safari_media_controls).
  See the browsers which support Picture-in-Picture on
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/picture-in-picture).
</Info>

```tsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      showPipButton
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">

Picture-in-Picture is not supported in React Native, due to lack of support in
`expo-av`.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### viewerId

Allows a wallet identifier to be passed to the backend which allows for querying views by an identifier. This should be an wallet's public address.

<Info>
  We are planning on adding further features to the viewer ID, such as "verified
  views" with a provable signature claim attached to these view counts. Reach
  out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/livepeer) if you're interested!
</Info>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      viewerId="0xabcd000000000000000000000000000000001234"
    />
  );
}
```

### autoUrlUpload

Enables automatic upload and playback from decentralized storage providers. Currently supports IPFS CIDs and IPFS/Arweave URLs. Defaults to `true`.

<Info>
  For IPFS HTTP gateway URLs, the player currently only supports “path style”
  URLs and does not support “subdomain style” URLs. The player will support both
  styles of URLs in a future update.
</Info>

If `fallback` is specified, while the URL upload is being processed in the background, the video will start non-transcoded playback immediately
(defaulting to `w3s.link` for IPFS and `arweave.net` for Arweave). Once this finishes, the Player will switch to playing from the transcoded version
from the Livepeer provider. To show/hide the indicator of current upload progress, see [`showUploadingIndicator`](#showuploadingindicator).

It is highly recommended for the best playback experience to upload from an Arweave/IPFS URL using `useCreateAsset` (with the format `ipfs://<CID>` or `ar://<HASH>`)
before presenting the content to the user - the first view with automatic URL upload can take a few minutes, then it will be permanently
cached and play back quickly.

<Info>
  An IPFS [v0 or v1 CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) or
  IPFS/Arweave URL (including directories) can be passed as the `src` or
  `playbackID` to the Player, and it will automatically detect if it is a
  dStorage identifier and attempt to play from a cached version. If the API does
  not have a cached version with the corresponding ID, the Player will upload
  the content using IPFS/Arweave, and then start playing the transcoded content
  back. This may take a few minutes. If `fallback` is specified, it will attempt
  to play back instantly from the provided gateway or default gateway.
</Info>

<Warning>
  For best performance, use a custom gateway URL, and ideally, use the same
  gateway and pinning service, to avoid timeout errors.
</Warning>

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Workout NFT"
      src="ipfs://QmNmNBQE3RqdkN3KpeBVxpGDHUe8c9Bh5YNerERNoo98rB/4038.mp4"
      autoUrlUpload={{ fallback: true, ipfsGateway: "https://w3s.link" }}
    />
  );
}
```

### showUploadingIndicator

Shows/hides the uploading indication for `autoUrlUpload`. Defaults to `true` - only used with `autoUrlUpload`.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      autoUrlUpload={{ fallback: true }}
      showUploadingIndicator={false}
    />
  );
}
```

### theme

Sets the Player-specific theme overrides. It is recommended to use [`LivepeerConfig`](/sdks/livepeer-js/LivepeerConfig) for
any global app styles, and the `theme` prop to override those styles on a per-Player basis.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      theme={{
        borderStyles: {
          containerBorderStyle: "hidden",
        },
        colors: {
          accent: "#00a55f",
        },
        space: {
          controlsBottomMarginX: "10px",
          controlsBottomMarginY: "5px",
          controlsTopMarginX: "15px",
          controlsTopMarginY: "10px",
        },
        radii: {
          containerBorderRadius: "0px",
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### children

<Tabs >
  <Tab title="React">

Overrides the custom controls for the Player. See the
[`Player` default controls](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/react/src/components/media/Player.tsx)
for more details on how the `ControlsContainer` component is used.

This can be used alongside `renderChildrenOutsideContainer` to render the children outside of the aspect ratio container.
This is used for custom controls, so children of the Player can use `useMediaController` without any parent elements.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### mediaElementRef

Sets the React [callback `ref`](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#callback-refs) passed to the underlying media element.
Useful when integrating with third party tools, or when access to the underlying video element is needed (usually it isn't!).
Simple refs are not supported - only callback refs (which will be called when the underlying media element is set/updated on initial render).

<Tabs >
  <Tab title="React">

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";

function PlayerComponent() {
  const mediaElementRef = useCallback((ref: HTMLMediaElement) => {
    console.log(ref.duration);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      mediaElementRef={mediaElementRef}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      mediaElementRef={async (ref) => {
        await ref?.setVolumeAsync(0.5);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### onPlaybackStatusUpdate

Callback called when the Player store status updates.
**This should be used with `playbackStatusSelector` to limit state updates.**
This allows developers to use the underlying state of the Player component in their UI.

```tsx
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="f5eese9wwl88k4g8"
      onPlaybackStatusUpdate={(muted) => console.log(muted)}
      playbackStatusSelector={(state) => state.muted}
    />
  );
}
```

## Hooks

### usePlayerList

<Warning>
  `usePlayerList` is currently only available for React Native, since there are
  List primitives which provide a standard API to hook into. We are working on a
  React version.
</Warning>

The `usePlayerList` hook makes it easy to preload and display videos in a
[`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)-compatible list, by using
[`viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfigcallbackpairs) to
trigger preloading on upcoming videos, and automatically playing/pausing media when it is shown/hidden from the list.

See our [Expo sample app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/tree/main/examples/expo) for a real-world example.

#### Usage

```tsx
const videos = [
  {
    title: "Fountain",
    playbackId: "6119i9hncfr7gopr",
  },
  {
    title: "Happy Dog",
    playbackId: "8cf0gfaqtuajakyf",
  },
];

function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemVisibleMinimumViewTime: 100,
    itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 60,
    itemPreload: 2,
  });

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={listProps.data}
      viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs={listProps.viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs}
      renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
        <Player
          {...item.playerProps}
          playbackId={item.playbackId}
          title={item.title}
          autoPlay
          loop
        />
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Return Value

The return value extends the `data` array which is passed into the hook, to add Player-specific props to it. The `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs`
prop is also returned, which must be passed into the `FlatList`-compatible list to maintain the correct preloading/playing states for the Player(s).

```tsx
{
  data: (
    TInputArray & {
      playerProps: {
        _isCurrentlyShown: boolean;
        priority: boolean;
      };
    }
  )[];

  viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs: ViewabilityConfigCallbackPairs;
}
```

#### Configuration

##### data

The data used in the list - required. This is extended to add Player-specific props, which are passed into the Player using `item.playerProps`.

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
  });

  return (
    <FlatList
      {...listProps}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <Player {...item.playerProps} playbackId={item.playbackId} />
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

##### itemPreload

The number of items to preload ahead of the currently-viewable Player. For instance, if `itemPreload` is set to 8 and there are 30 items in the Player list,
when the user is currently viewing the 5th item, the 6th-14th Players will actively preload in the background. Defaults to 3.

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemPreload: 8,
  });
}
```

##### itemVisibleMinimumViewTime

The minimum amount of time in milliseconds that an item must be viewable before it is considered "shown". This will also be the delay
between when the item becomes visible and when the autoPlay logic is triggered. Defaults to 100 ms, use `null` to unset.
See [FlatList's `viewabilityConfig`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) for more details.

```tsx {4}
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemVisibleMinimumViewTime: 300,
  });
}
```

##### itemVisiblePercentThreshold

The percent of the item that must be visible for the item to count as "viewable", from 0-100. Defaults to 60%, use `null` to unset.
See [FlatList's `viewabilityConfig`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) for more details.

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 35,
  });
}
```

##### itemVisibleViewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold

The percent of the viewport that must be covered for a partially occluded item to count as "viewable", 0-100. No default value.
See [FlatList's `viewabilityConfig`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) for more details.

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemVisiblePercentThreshold: null, // the default item percent can be unset, if needed
    itemVisibleViewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold: 75,
  });
}
```

##### itemVisibleWaitForInteraction

Indicates that the item is not considered viewable until the user scrolls or `recordInteraction` is called after render. Defaults to false.
See [FlatList's `viewabilityConfig`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) for more details.

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { listProps } = usePlayerList({
    data: videos,
    itemVisibleWaitForInteraction: true,
  });
}
```

## SSR

<Warning>
  The following section only applies to web-based use-cases - React Native has
  no concept of SSR.
</Warning>

### Next.js

The Player also comes with a [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr) prefetch query, `prefetchPlayer`,
which makes it easy to prefetch the data used internally for the Player during server-side rendering.

First, you add a [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) function to the page which
you want to prefetch data on. The props should match the Player props to ensure that the correct data is prefetched.

```tsx
import { prefetchPlayer, studioProvider } from "@livepeer/react";

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const dehydratedState = await prefetchPlayer(
    { playbackId },
    { provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: "yourStudioApiKey" }) }
  );

  return {
    props: {
      dehydratedState,
    },
    revalidate: 600,
  };
};
```

We need to update the `_app.tsx` to pass the `dehydratedState` in `pageProps` to the LivepeerConfig. We also move the
`livepeerClient` into a useMemo hook so that a new client is created on each request.

```tsx
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from "@livepeer/react";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

import { useMemo } from "react";

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{ dehydratedState: string }>) {
  // we create a new livepeer client on each request so data is
  // not shared between users
  const livepeerClient = useMemo(
    () =>
      createReactClient({
        provider: studioProvider({
          apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
        }),
      }),
    []
  );

  return (
    <LivepeerConfig
      dehydratedState={pageProps?.dehydratedState}
      client={livepeerClient}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

That's it! You now have data prefetching on the server, which is passed to the browser and used to hydrate the initial query client.

### Other Frameworks

The process is very similar for other frameworks, with the exception that there is a `clearClient` boolean which should be used
to ensure that the client cache is not reused across users.

```tsx
import { prefetchPlayer, studioProvider } from "@livepeer/react";

export const handleRequest = async (req, res) => {
  const dehydratedState = await prefetchPlayer(
    {
      playbackId,
      clearClient: true,
    },
    { provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: "yourStudioApiKey" }) }
  );

  // sanitize the custom SSR generated data
  // https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0

  res.send(`
    <html>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
        <script>
          window.__REACT_QUERY_STATE__ = ${yourSanitizedDehydratedState};
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
};
```

## Technical Details

The Player is opinionated about the ways it handles playback of media, specifically regarding HLS reconnect and playback URL choices.

### HLS Reconnect

The Player will perform a linear backoff strategy when it encounters any network/response errors. The reconnect will initially wait one second,
and add one second every retry. This ensures that if there are any intermittent network/API errors, they are resolved as quickly as possible.
Most open source players do not do this automatically, which results in a poor playback experience for the user.

### MP4 Playback URLs

When videos are uploaded which are shorter than two minutes, the Studio provider will automatically generate MP4 renditions alongside the
usual HLS playback URL. This allows for rapid playback/caching at the CDN layer to enable your application to load video instantly.

The MP4 renditions will be prioritized over HLS and are chosen with the following algorithm: the device screen width is multiplied by a
static multiplier (currently set to `x2.5`). This value is then compared to the rendition widths, and the
renditions are prioritized based on the distance between these values. This results in a choice of a rendition
which is close to the screen size without visual quality issues. For instance, a device with a 1280 pixel width
would compute `1280px * 2.5 = 3200px`, and then sort the MP4 renditions by which are closest to this value.
