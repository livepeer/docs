Livepeer React is a set of prebuilt and customizable UI components for building
live or on-demand video experiences.

## Installation

Install Livepeer React using your favorite package manager.

```
npm i @livepeer/react
```

## Build with the primitives

You can use `Player` primitives to build a media playback experience, and
`Broadcast` primitives to build an in-browser broadcasting experience.

Below, we create a simple player and broadcast experience with minimal controls.
The player only includes a play/pause button, and the broadcast has a start/stop
streaming button.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Player.tsx">
    <iframe
      src={`https://ui-kit-docs-embed.vercel.app/player/getting_started`}
      height="600px"
      width="100%"
      frameBorder="0"
      allowFullScreen
      allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; display-capture; camera; microphone"
      style={{
        borderRadius: 10,
        backgroundColor: "black",
      }}
    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Broadcast.tsx">
    <iframe
      src={`https://ui-kit-docs-embed.vercel.app/broadcast/getting_started`}
      height="600px"
      width="100%"
      frameBorder="0"
      allowFullScreen
      allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; display-capture; camera; microphone"
      style={{
        borderRadius: 10,
        backgroundColor: "black",
      }}
    />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integrate with Studio

Now that we've started using the primitives, we need something to play or
broadcast! We can integrate with the Livepeer Studio API to start playing media.

The below example shows the use of the `livepeer` JS SDK, but any other
language's SDK can be used to fetch the playback info or stream object.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="get-source.ts">
    ```ts
    // this is a server function, which uses the API key
    // on the backend
    import livepeer from "livepeer"
    import { getSrc } from "@livepeer/react/external";

    export async function getSourceForPlaybackId(playbackId: string) {
      const playbackInfo = await livepeer.playback.get(playbackId);

      // the return value can be passed directly to the Player as `src`
      return getSrc(playbackInfo);
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="get-ingest.ts">
    ```ts
    // this is a server function, which uses the API key
    // on the backend
    import livepeer from "livepeer"
    import { getIngest } from "@livepeer/react/external";

    export async function getIngestUrlForStreamId(streamId: string) {
      const stream = await livepeer.stream.get(streamId);

      // the return value can be passed directly to the Broadcast as `ingestUrl`
      return getIngest(stream.stream);
    }
    ```
