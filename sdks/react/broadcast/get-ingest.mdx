```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";
import { getIngest } from "@livepeer/react";

// Usage with a stream key
const streamKey = "your-stream-key-here";
const whipUrl = getIngest(streamKey, {
  baseUrl: "https://playback.livepeer.studio/webrtc",
});

// Usage with Livepeer stream data
const livepeerStreamData = {
  id: "stream-id",
  streamKey: "your-stream-key-here",
  // Other unused Livepeer stream data...
};

// This is either a string or null, depending on whether
// the input was parsed successfully
const whipUrlFromLivepeer = getIngest(livepeerStreamData);

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root ingest={whipUrlFromLivepeer}>
    {/* All child components. */}
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

### Functionality

`getIngest` simplifies the process of preparing ingest sources for broadcasting
by standardizing them into WHIP URLs.

#### Input Types

The function supports a variety of input types to accommodate different
broadcasting setups:

- **String**: Directly returns the string if it's a valid URL. Constructs a WHIP
  URL using a base URL for stream keys.
- **LivepeerStream**: Uses the `streamKey` from Livepeer stream data to generate
  a WHIP URL.
- **CloudflareStreamData**: Extracts the URL from Cloudflare stream data
  objects.

Optional parameters (`opts`) include:

- **baseUrl**: The base URL for constructing WHIP URLs. Essential when the input
  is a stream key.

#### Output Format

The function outputs a WHIP URL string suitable for use in broadcasting setups,
or `null` if the input can't be processed into a valid WHIP URL.
