<Warning>
  As you can see in the above example, the component will request permissions
  for video/audio input - so it prompts the user for access to their microphone
  and camera **upon component mount**.

The `getUserMedia` browser API used to get the video/audio is only available in
secure contexts (HTTPS).

</Warning>

#### Features

- Synchronizes state with the HTML5 video element
- Keyboard hotkeys (`B` to toggle whether the broadcast is enabled, `L` to
  toggle audio, `V` to toggle video, `D` to broadcast display media, `C` for
  next video source, `M` for next audio source)
- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) design patterns
- Handles all common browser APIs, and old WebKit/Firefox APIs (see
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_mediadevices_getusermedia))

<Info>
  The Broadcast above will work with only keyboard shortcuts, without any custom
  controls.

### Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.Video />
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts most props suitable for a HTML5 `video` tag, except for
`src` and `poster` which are managed internally or provided explicitly through
props.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-video`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Broadcast.

### `data-enabled`

Indicates the enabled state of the broadcast, `"true"` when broadcasting is
enabled and `"false"` when it is not.
