import { ExampleWithCode } from "/snippets/ui-kit/react/iframe-example.mdx";

<ExampleWithCode type="broadcast" id="screenshare" />

## Features

- Automatic conditional rendering based on
  [`getDisplayMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia)
  status and browser API availability, customizable with the `matcher` pattern
- Handles all common browser APIs, and old WebKit APIs (see
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_mediadevices_getdisplaymedia))
- Compatible with CSS animations for dynamic enter/exit animations

<Warning>
  The `getDisplayMedia` API is only available in secure contexts (HTTPS).

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.ScreenshareTrigger />
      <Broadcast.ScreenshareIndicator />
    </Broadcast.Container>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.Controls>
        <Broadcast.ScreenshareTrigger />
        <Broadcast.ScreenshareIndicator />
      </Broadcast.Controls>
    </Broadcast.Container>
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `ScreenshareTrigger`

Accepts all props for a typical button HTML element.

### `ScreenshareIndicator`

#### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, keeps the component mounted at all times, useful for
controlling animations with external libraries.

#### `matcher`

A prop to define the condition under which the `ScreenshareIndicator` should be
visible. It can be a boolean directly matching the screenshare state or a
function providing custom logic to determine visibility.

## Data Attributes

### `ScreenshareTrigger`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-screenshare-trigger`

Serves to identify the component's role within the broadcast interface.

#### `data-active`

Indicates the current screenshare state, `"true"` when screensharing is active
and `"false"` when it is not.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the trigger, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., screensharing is supported) and `"false"` denoting it's
not visible.

### `ScreenshareIndicator`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-screenshare-indicator`

Identifies the component's role as a visual indicator of the screenshare state
within the broadcast interface.

#### `data-active`

Shows the current screenshare state, `"true"` when screensharing is active and
`"false"` when it is not.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible based on the `matcher` or screenshare state and `"false"`
denoting it's not visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
