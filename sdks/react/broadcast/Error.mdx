<Info>
  The `Error` component can be shown for all error types, or a subset of them.
  It is usually recommended to be more granular in the error types, since some
  errors are more "fatal" and some cannot be recovered from.

## Features

- Conditional rendering based on the error state, customizable with the
  `matcher` pattern
- Dynamic data attributes for custom styling based on the current error state

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.ErrorIndicator />
    </Broadcast.Container>
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a div element, in addition to the
following specific props:

### `forceMount`

A boolean to force the component's presence in the DOM, useful for controlling
animations with external libraries.

### `matcher`

A prop to define the condition under which the `ErrorIndicator` should be
visible. It can be a string indicating a broad category of errors (like `"all"`
or `"not-permissions"`) or a more specific error type. Alternatively, it can be
a function for custom logic, receiving the PlaybackError type and returning a
boolean for whether it should be shown.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-error-indicator`

Always present to indicate the component's role.

### `data-error-state`

Indicates whether there is an error (`"true"` or `"false"`).

### `data-error-type`

Specifies the type of the current error or `"none"` if no error is present.

Could be one of:
`"offline" | "access-control" | "fallback" | "permissions" | "unknown" | "none"`

### `data-visible`

Reflects whether the indicator is currently visible (`"true"` or `"false"`).

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
