<Info>
  The `useStore` hook is from
  [`zustand`](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?tab=readme-ov-file#using-zustand-without-react),
  and inherits all of the documentation for Zustand stores.
</Info>

## Features

- Flexible interaction with the broadcast state store
- Based on Zustand's `useStore` hooks

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";
import { useBroadcastContext, useStore } from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    {/** The `useBroadcastContext` hook can be used in any component,
    as long as it's inside the Broadcast.Root React Context provider */}
    <CustomComponent />
  </Broadcast.Root>
);

function CustomComponent({
  style,
  __scopeBroadcast,
}: Broadcast.BroadcastScopedProps<{}>) {
  const context = useBroadcastContext("CustomComponent", __scopeBroadcast);

  // use selectors with the Zustand store, to make sure your component doesn't render
  // on every store state change
  const { status } = useStore(context.store, ({ status }) => ({
    status,
  }));

  return status;
}
```

## State

The `useBroadcastContext` hook returns a Zustand store, which contains the
`BroadcastState`.

### `aria`

The ARIA text for the controls given the current state.

```tsx
type BroadcastAriaText = {
  audioTrigger: string;
  start: string;
  screenshareTrigger: string;
  videoTrigger: string;
};
```

### `audio`

Indicates whether the broadcast's audio track is turned on.

### `enabled`

Specifies whether the broadcast is currently active or in "preview" mode.

### `hydrated`

Reflects whether the broadcast store is hydrated, indicating if initial data has
been loaded into the state.

### `mediaDevices`

A list of the current media devices (based on
[MediaDeviceInfo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDeviceInfo)),
which changes based on permissions or when a user starts sharing their display.

```tsx
type MediaDeviceInfoExtended = Omit<MediaDeviceInfo, "label" | "toJSON"> & {
  /**
   * This is a convenience field added to MediaDeviceInfo to help easily add a device picker.
   *
   * For security reasons, the label field will blank unless an active media stream exists
   * or the user has granted persistent permission for media device access. The set of device labels
   * could otherwise be used as part of a fingerprinting mechanism to identify a user.
   *
   * When the label field is not blank, these are the same value. Otherwise, the value is a friendly default.
   */
  friendlyName: string;
  /**
   * For security reasons, the label field is blank unless an active media stream exists
   * or the user has granted persistent permission for media device access. The set of device labels
   * could otherwise be used as part of a fingerprinting mechanism to identify a user.
   *
   * We override it here to be null when it is blank, for easier developer usage.
   */
  label: string | null;
};

mediaDevices: MediaDeviceInfoExtended[] | null;
```

### `mediaStream`

The [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream)
for the current broadcast, containing the audio and video tracks.

```tsx
mediaStream: MediaStream | null;
```

### `mounted`

Whether the broadcast component is currently mounted in the DOM.

### `peerConnection`

The
[RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection)
object for the broadcast, managing the connection between the local and remote
peers.

```tsx
peerConnection: RTCPeerConnection | null;
```

### `status`

The current status of the broadcast, which can be "live", "pending", or "idle".

```tsx
status: "live" | "pending" | "idle";
```

### `ingestUrl`

The WHIP ingest URL used for the broadcast.

```tsx
ingestUrl: string | null;
```

### `video`

Indicates if the broadcast's video track is turned on.

### `mediaDeviceIds`

The IDs of the currently selected media devices.

```tsx
mediaDeviceIds: MediaDeviceIds;
```

### `__initialProps`

The initial properties passed into the broadcast component. This is an internal
object used by Broadcast.

```tsx
__initialProps: InitialBroadcastProps;
```

### `__device`

Information about the broadcast device's capabilities and support. This is an
internal object used by Broadcast, but can be used for detecting device
capabilities.

```tsx
type BroadcastDeviceInformation = {
  version: string;
  /** If the environment supports mediaDevices */
  isMediaDevicesSupported: boolean;
  /** If the environment supports RTCPeerConnection */
  isRTCPeerConnectionSupported: boolean;
  /** If the environment supports sharing display media */
  isDisplayMediaSupported: boolean;
};

__device: BroadcastDeviceInformation;
```

### `__controls`

The current state of broadcast controls. This is an internal object used by
Broadcast.

```tsx
__controls: BroadcastControlsState;
```

### `__controlsFunctions`

An object containing functions to manipulate the broadcast's state, such as
toggling audio/video, updating the media stream, and setting the peer
connection.

<Warning>
  These functions are internal - please refer to the UI Kit source code before
  interacting with these functions.
</Warning>

```tsx
__controlsFunctions: {
    requestDeviceListInfo: () => void;
    requestForceRenegotiate: () => void;
    requestMediaDeviceId: (deviceId: AudioDeviceId, type: keyof MediaDeviceIds) => void;
    rotateAudioSource: () => void;
    rotateVideoSource: () => void;
    setIngestUrl: (ingestUrl: string) => void;
    setInitialState: (ids: MediaDeviceIds, audio: boolean, video: boolean) => void;
    setPeerConnection: (peerConnection: RTCPeerConnection) => void;
    setStatus: (status: BroadcastStatus) => void;
    setMediaDeviceIds: (mediaDevices: Partial<MediaDeviceIds>) => void;
    toggleAudio: () => void;
    toggleDisplayMedia: () => void;
    toggleEnabled: () => void;
    toggleVideo: () => void;
    updateDeviceList: (mediaDevices: MediaDeviceInfo[]) => void;
    updateMediaStream: (mediaStream: MediaStream) => void;
};
```
