<Info>
  This is a comprehensive example of how the Broadcast elements can fit together
  to build an advanced in-browser streaming experience. This does not only show
  the Root Broadcast, but how the Root can be used to provide a state store to
  all of its children.
</Info>

## Features

- Pure React Context provider to pass the broadcast and media state store to all
  components
- Automatic SDP negotiation with a
  [WebRTC WHIP](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-01.html)
  endpoint

<Info>
  The Broadcast component utilizes WebRTC for streaming and consistently employs
  STUN/TURN servers for the WebRTC connection. This setup facilitates
  broadcasting despite corporate firewalls or port restrictions. The component
  adheres to WHIP/WHEP standards for ingest/egress SDP negotiation, making it
  compatible with any WHIP/WHEP ingest endpoint.
</Info>

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    {/* All child components which use the state store. */}
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Usage

The `Player.Root` component is a React Context wrapper which passes the player
state store down to all of the child components. It is responsible for creating
the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) state store which is consumed
by the children, and listens for media/browser events and keeps state in sync.

<Info>
  The Player automatically handles different source types, such as WebRTC, MP4, and HLS.
  These are seamlessly integrated so that playback has low latency under all
  network conditions.

It is compatible with WebRTC WHEP endpoints, HLS (and low latency HLS), or
typical media file playable by an HTML5 video element (MP4, WebM).

## Props

### `ingestUrl`

Configures the WHIP WebRTC ingest URL for the `Broadcast` component. You can
create the `ingestUrl` by passing
[`getIngest`](/sdks/react/broadcast/get-ingest) a string (interpreted
as a Livepeer Studio stream key or URL), Livepeer Studio stream data, or
Cloudflare stream data. `Broadcast` is compatible with all WHIP playback
endpoints.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root ingestUrl={getIngest(streamKey)}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `aspectRatio`

Specifies the aspect ratio of the content. Recommended for an optimal
broadcasting experience to minimize
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The default value is `16 / 9`.

Set to `null` to disable the aspect ratio container (see `Container`).

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root aspectRatio={16 / 9}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `forceEnabled`

Determines whether the WebRTC stream should start immediately after the user
allows access to their video/audio input. The default is `false`, which previews
the video first, then streams media to the server upon activation.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root forceEnabled={true}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `audio`

Controls whether audio is enabled initially for the broadcast. The default is
`true`. Set to `false` to start the broadcast without requesting an audio track.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root audio={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `video`

Controls whether video is enabled initially for the broadcast. The default is
`true`. Set to `false` to start the broadcast without requesting a video track.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root video={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `hotkeys`

Enables keyboard hotkeys for controlling the broadcast. Enabled by default
(`true`). It's recommended to follow ARIA guidelines by keeping this enabled
unless you're implementing custom hotkeys or there's a conflict with existing
ones.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root hotkeys={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `creatorId`

Sets the creator ID for the broadcast, useful for metrics and viewership API
integration.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root creatorId="creator123">{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `onError`

An optional callback for handling broadcasting errors. It's called with `null`
when the previous error is resolved. The callback receives the parameter:

```ts
type PlaybackError = {
  type: "offline" | "access-control" | "fallback" | "permissions" | "unknown";
  message: string;
};
```

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root onError={(error) => console.log(error)}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `timeout`

Sets the timeout duration for playback before switching to the next source,
including SDP negotiation for WebRTC, waiting for WebRTC to play, and server
responses. The default is 10000 milliseconds.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root timeout={15000}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `storage`

Configures the storage option for saving persistent states like volume and video
quality. The default is `localStorage` in the browser. Set to `null` to disable
storage.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root storage={null}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```
