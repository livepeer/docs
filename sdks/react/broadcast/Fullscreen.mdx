import { ExampleWithCode } from "/snippets/ui-kit/react/iframe-example.mdx";

<ExampleWithCode type="broadcast" id="fullscreen" />

## Features

- Automatic conditional rendering based on fullscreen status and browser API
  availability, customizable with the `matcher` pattern
- Handles all browser APIs back to IE11, with special handling for iOS
- Compatible with CSS animations for dynamic enter/exit animations

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.FullscreenTrigger />
      <Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator />
    </Broadcast.Container>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.Controls>
        <Broadcast.FullscreenTrigger />
        <Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator />
      </Broadcast.Controls>
    </Broadcast.Container>
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `FullscreenIndicator`

#### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, keeps the component mounted at all times, useful for
controlling animations with external libraries.

#### `matcher`

A prop to define the condition under which the `FullscreenIndicator` should be
visible. It can be a boolean directly matching the fullscreen state or a
function providing custom logic to determine visibility.
