<Info>
  The `Enabled` components are used to generally start and stop the broadcast.
  The broadcast, by default, starts disabled so the user can preview their video
  before going live.
</Info>

## Features

- Conditional rendering based on the enabled state, customizable with the
  `matcher` pattern
- Dynamic data attributes for custom styling based on the current enabled state

<Info>
  Toggling "enabled" turns WHIP WebRTC ingest on or off, which when "on" the
  Broadcast component will make a POST request with an SDP payload to the WHIP
  endpoint. When "off", it will stop sending data to the WebRTC ingest.
</Info>

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.EnabledTrigger />
    <Broadcast.EnabledIndicator />
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `EnabledTrigger`

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element.

### `EnabledIndicator`

The component accepts all props for a span element.

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, ensures the component is always mounted. This is
particularly useful for managing animations with external animation libraries
and ensuring visibility during dynamic broadcast scenarios.

##### `matcher`

A prop intended to define the circumstances under which the `EnabledIndicator`
should be visible. It can be a boolean that directly corresponds to the enabled
state or a function providing custom logic for visibility determination based on
the enabled state.

## Data Attributes

### `EnabledTrigger`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-enabled-trigger`

Serves to identify the component's role within the broadcast interface.

#### `data-enabled`

Indicates the current broadcast state, `"true"` when broadcasting is enabled and
`"false"` when it is disabled.

### `EnabledIndicator`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-enabled-indicator`

Identifies the component's role as a visual indicator of the broadcast state
within the broadcast interface.

#### `data-enabled`

Shows the current broadcast state, `"true"` when broadcasting is enabled and
`"false"` when it is disabled.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible based on the `matcher` or broadcast state and `"false"`
denoting it's not visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
