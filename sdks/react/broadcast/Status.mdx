## Features

- Synchronizes broadcast status with a visual indicator

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

export default () => (
  <Broadcast.Root>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.StatusIndicator />
    </Broadcast.Container>
    <Broadcast.Container>
      <Broadcast.Controls>
        <Broadcast.StatusIndicator />
      </Broadcast.Controls>
    </Broadcast.Container>
  </Broadcast.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, ensures the component is always mounted. This is
particularly useful for managing animations with external animation libraries.

### `matcher`

A prop required to define the conditions under which the `StatusIndicator`
should be visible. It can be a specific `BroadcastStatus` value or a function
that provides custom logic for visibility determination based on the broadcast
status.

The status can be of the type: `"live" | "pending" | "idle"`

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-controls-status-indicator`

Serves to identify the component's role within the broadcast interface.

### `data-status`

Shows the current broadcast status as a string.

The status can be of the type: `"live" | "pending" | "idle"`

### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible based on the `matcher` or broadcast status and `"false"`
denoting it's not visible.
