<Info>
  Livepeer React `v4.0.0+` was a complete rewrite of the library to support
  video primitives.
</Info>

## Introduction

This migration guide is designed to assist you in transitioning from the
previous version of the `@livepeer/react` library to the new major release. This
update is a significant overhaul aimed at addressing several key issues with the
previous releases.

## Before you start

### Major changes

- The library has been rewritten to offer unstyled, composable `<Player />` and
  `<Broadcast />` primitives based on
  [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction).
- The components are now highly composable, moving away from the monolithic
  design of the previous versions.
  - All components support the
    [`asChild`](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition)
    pattern, where the component will instead clone the part's child and passing
    it the props and behavior required to make it functional.
  - For instance: `<FullscreenTrigger asChild>{...}</FullscreenTrigger>` will
    not render a DOM element, and instead copy all of it's properties to the
    child component, which will behave as a fullscreen trigger.
- The components are more aligned with web standards, allowing direct prop
  passing to elements (notably the `Video` component).
- Automatic data fetching and CORS API key usage within components have been
  removed to enhance security and reduce developer confusion.
  - We highly recommend moving away from CORS API keys and making API requests
    from your backend. _We plan to deprecate CORS API keys in the future._
- The React Native package has been deprecated. The package was not
  well-maintained and we have focused on web components for Livepeer React.

## Migration steps

### Primitives

Replace your usage of the single `<Player />` and `<Broadcast />` components
with the new composable primitives. These include:

#### Player

- `<Player.Root />`
- `<Player.Container />`
- `<Player.Video />`
- `<Player.Controls />`
- `<Player.LoadingIndicator />`
- `<Player.FullscreenTrigger />`
- ...and more.

Check out our [complete example](/sdks/react/Player) for how these can
be composed to build a video player, modeled after the 3.x versions of the
Player.

#### Broadcast

- `<Broadcast.Root />`
- `<Broadcast.Container />`
- `<Broadcast.Video />`
- `<Broadcast.Controls />`
- `<Broadcast.SourceSelect />`
- `<Broadcast.VideoEnabledIndicator />`
- ...and more.

Check out the [complete example](/sdks/react/Broadcast) for how these
can be composed to build a complete in-browser broadcast experience.

### Data fetching

1. All data fetching logic from the Livepeer Studio API has been removed from
   the Player and Broadcast components.
   - This includes all of the `useCreateAsset`, `useStream`, etc.
2. You will now need to use the [`livepeer`](/sdks/javascript) JS SDK (or
   [another SDK](/sdks/introduction), depending on your applications's API
   language) for data fetching and interaction.
   - You must now make API requests in your backend to fetch playback info for a
     playback ID.
   - Use [`getSrc`](/sdks/react/player/get-src) utility function with
     the Player or [`getIngest`](/sdks/react/broadcast/get-ingest)
     utility function with Broadcast to parse the JSON responses from the API.

### Unstyled by default

1. The components are now unstyled by default. You will need to apply your own
   styles.
2. Refer to the documentation for example styles that mimic the previous
   versions, which you can customize as needed.

### Recommendations

1. Embrace the flexibility of **Composable components**. Use the `asChild`
   pattern for more control over the rendering of components.
2. Use **automatic poster images** by passing the
   [playback info](/api-reference/playback/get) response to `getSrc`.
3. There are no changes required to **resume progress on fallback**, which
   resumes playback from where it was interrupted when an error occurs, and the
   player falls back to another playback protocol.
4. Use `useMediaContext` for building custom components. See the implementation
   of the primitives as an example of how to implement them.

### Callouts

1. Note the discontinuation of `autoUrlUpload` and direct IPFS playback. See
   below for recommendations for how to migrate from this.
2. The new build system includes `use client` and `use server` directives in the
   output. This means that you can directly import the client components into a
   RSC and you don't need to wrap them. If you don't use React Server
   Components, this doesn't affect you.

### React Native

The React Native package has been deprecated. Consider seeking alternative
solutions or consulting the team for future support plans.

### Replacing `autoUrlUpload`

To replace the usage of `autoUrlUpload`, use the following pseudocode as a guide
for how the logic used to work on the frontend.

```tsx /api/playback
import { Livepeer } from "livepeer";

import { parseCid, parseArweaveTxId } from "@livepeer/core/utils";

const livepeer = new Livepeer({
  apiKey: process.env.STUDIO_API_KEY ?? "",
});

const possibleIpfsCid =
  "https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeie2hgozfameyzawq6kkzc3tuf67g4kkufm4hoefxczpfe2fen2riu";

// if the source contains a CID or Arweave TX ID, these utility functions will parse out the
// ID and be non-null
const decentralizedSource =
  parseCid(possibleIpfsCid) ?? parseArweaveTxId(possibleIpfsCid);

if (decentralizedSource?.id) {
  // we check if the CID/Arweave ID already exists in the playback info endpoint
  const response = await livepeer.playback.get(decentralizedSource.id);

  if (!response.playbackInfo) {
    // the CID/Arweave ID doesn't exist, so we import it by the URL
    await livepeer.asset.createViaURL({
      // this is the IPFS CID, or Arweave transaction ID
      name: decentralizedSource.id,
      // the formatted IPFS CID or Arweave tx ID as a URL:
      // ipfs://{CID} or ar://{CID}
      url: decentralizedSource.url,
    });

    // ...continue to poll the created asset and use the decentralized identifier
    // to get the playback info, and pass to `getSrc` to use with <Player.Root />

    const imported = await livepeer.playback.get(decentralizedSource.id);

    const source = getSrc(imported.playbackInfo);

    return source;
  }
}
```
