<ExampleWithCode type="player" id="root" />

<Info>
  This is a comprehensive example of how the Player elements can fit together to
  build an advanced video player. This does not only show the Root Player, but
  how the Root can be used to provide a state store to all of its children.
</Info>

## Features

- Pure React Context provider to pass the media store state to all components

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    {/* All child components which use the state store. */}
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Compatibility

The compatibility table below applies to the Player broadly, since the Root
component is only a React context.

## Usage

The `Player.Root` component is a React Context wrapper which passes the player
state store down to all of the child components. It is responsible for creating
the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) state store which is consumed
by the children, and listens for media/browser events and keeps state in sync.

<Info>
  The Player automatically handles different source types, such as WebRTC, MP4, and HLS.
  These are seamlessly integrated so that playback has low latency under all
  network conditions.

It is compatible with WebRTC WHEP endpoints, HLS (and low latency HLS), or
typical media file playable by an HTML5 video element (MP4, WebM).

## Props

### `src`

Defines the source for the Player. It accepts `Src[]`, which can be derived from
various sources like Livepeer playback info, Cloudflare stream data, Mux URLs,
or simple strings.

See `getSrc` for docs on how to easily generate this parameter.

### `aspectRatio`

Specifies the aspect ratio of the content. Recommended for an optimal
broadcasting experience to minimize
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The default value is `16 / 9`.

Set to `null` to disable the aspect ratio container (see `Container`).

```tsx
<Player.Root aspectRatio={16 / 9}>{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `hotkeys`

Enables keyboard hotkeys for controlling the player. Enabled by default
(`true`). It's recommended to follow ARIA guidelines by keeping this enabled
unless you're implementing custom hotkeys or there's a conflict with existing
ones.

```tsx
<Player.Root hotkeys={false}>{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `viewerId`

Sets the viewer ID for the broadcast, useful for metrics and viewership API
integration.

```tsx
<Player.Root viewerId="viewer123">{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `onError`

An optional callback for handling broadcasting errors. It's called with `null`
when the previous error is resolved. The callback receives the parameter:

```ts
type PlaybackError = {
  type: "offline" | "access-control" | "fallback" | "permissions" | "unknown";
  message: string;
};
```

```tsx
<Player.Root onError={(error) => console.log(error)}>{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `jwt` or `accessKey`

<Info>
  These define ways to play back a video which has a playback policy applied to
  it. Your application can prevent playback unless the user meets
  application-specific requirements. This can be done either with JWTs or
  webhooks.
</Info>

Defines the JSON Web Token (JWT) or access key used to access media gated by a
`jwt` or `webhook` playback policy respectively. It's crucial for implementing
application-specific access control like restricting viewership based on certain
criteria (e.g., having an activated account, etc.).

```tsx
<Player.Root jwt={jwt}>{...}</Player.Root>
<Player.Root accessKey="access-key">{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `lowLatency`

Enables low-latency playback for live streams via WebRTC by default. If set to
`"force"`, it forces WebRTC playback and disables fallback to HLS. This is ideal
for applications requiring low latency and can tolerate possible connectivity
issues inherent to WebRTC.

Defaults to `true`. If this does not succeed in playing back (commonly due to a
slow network or connectivity issues), the Player will automatically fall back to
HLS playback. Also, if the stream contains B-frames (bidirectional frames, which
are common for users streaming with OBS or other streaming apps), the Player
will automatically switch to HLS, so that out-of-order frames are not displayed.

<Warning>
  OBS users should be instructed to use the Livepeer stream profile, or to
  manually turn off B-frames in their stream. See our [Stream from
  OBS](/developers/guides/stream-via-obs) docs for more information.
</Warning>

```tsx
<Player.Root lowLatency="force">{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `timeout`

Sets the timeout duration for playback before switching to the next source,
including SDP negotiation for WebRTC, waiting for WebRTC to play, and server
responses. The default is 10000 milliseconds.

```tsx
<Player.Root timeout={15000}>{...}</Player.Root>
```

### `storage`

Configures the storage option for saving persistent states like volume and video
quality. The default is `localStorage` in the browser. Set to `null` to disable
storage.

```tsx
<Player.Root storage={null}>{...}</Player.Root>
```
