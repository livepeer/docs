<Info>
  All of the `Seek` components extend from
  [`@radix-ui/react-slider`](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/slider),
  and inherits all of the documentation for those components.
</Info>

## Features

- Composes a slider for the current progress and buffer, and handles syncing
  with the underlying media element
- Keyboard navigation (with Radix) and adheres to
  [WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) design patterns

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.LiveIndicator>
      <Player.Seek>
        <Player.Track>
          <Player.SeekBuffer />
          <Player.Range />
        </Player.Track>
        <Player.Thumb />
      </Player.Seek>
    </Player.LiveIndicator>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `Seek`

The component accepts all props for a
[Radix Slider](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/slider)
element.

#### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

### `SeekBuffer`

The component accepts all props for a
[Radix Track](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/slider)
element.

It is usually not used as the Slider Track (since the seekable media isn't
constrained by the amount buffered), but can be used for it, depending on the
use-case.

## Data Attributes

Both components assign several data attributes to their underlying elements to
reflect the current state, user interactions, and visibility conditions.

### `Seek`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-seek`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-duration`

Indicates the total duration of the media.

#### `data-progress`

Shows the current progress as a percentage of the total duration.

#### `data-live`

Indicates if the current media is live, `"true"` for live and `"false"` for
non-live media.

#### `data-buffered`

Shows the portion of the media that has been buffered.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the slider, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., the media is not live) and `"false"` denoting it's not
visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.

### `SeekBuffer`

##### `data-livepeer-controls-seek-buffer`

Identifies the component's role within the Seek slider.

##### `data-buffered`

Shows the portion of the media that has been buffered.
