import { ExampleWithCode } from "/snippets/ui-kit/react/iframe-example.mdx";

<ExampleWithCode type="player" id="time" />

## Features

- Automatic display of friendly time from state store
- Handles live and static assets (e.g. no fixed duration vs fixed duration)

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.Time />
    </Player.Container>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.Controls>
        <Player.Time />
      </Player.Controls>
    </Player.Container>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a span element, except for
`children`, since the formatted time will be rendered as the only child.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-controls-time`

Serves to identify the component's role in the playback interface.

### `data-duration`

### `data-progress`

Indicates the current progress of the media playback, usually represented as a
