  is combined with Poster
</Info>

## Features

- Conditional rendering based on the error state, customizable with the
  `matcher` pattern
- Dynamic data attributes for custom styling based on the current error state

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.ErrorIndicator />
    </Player.Container>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a div element, in addition to the
following specific props:

### `forceMount`

A boolean value that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted.
This is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

### `matcher`

A prop intended to define the circumstances under which the `LoadingIndicator`
should be visible. It can be a direct boolean comparison with the loading state
or a function that provides custom logic for visibility determination.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-loading-indicator`

Serves to identify the component's role.

### `data-loading`

Displays the current loading state, `"true"` when media is loading and `"false"`
when it's not.

### `data-visible`

Indicates the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible and `"false"` denoting it's not.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
