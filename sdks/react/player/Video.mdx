#### Features

- Keyboard hotkeys (`←`/`→` to seek, `K` to pause, `M` to toggle mute, `F`
  fullscreen, `I` picture-in-picture)
- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) design patterns

### Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Video />
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts most props suitable for a HTML5 `video` tag, except for
`src`, `poster`, `autoPlay`, and `preload`, which are managed internally or
provided explicitly through props.

### `poster`

Optional. Controls the poster source. By default, it uses the thumbnail from the
`Root` src input. Set to `null` to disable the default poster image from the
`Root` src.

### `hlsConfig`

Optional. Controls the HLS.js config. By default, it adds JWT or Access Token
headers to HLS segment requests.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-video`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

### `data-livepeer-source-type`

Indicates the type of the current source, such as "none" when there's no source,
or other types based on the media being played.

This can be of the type: `"audio" | "video" | "hls" | "webrtc" | "none"`
