  It inherits all of the documentation for the component.
</Info>

## Features

- Provides an easy way to portal controls out of the Root components

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Portal>
      {/* Place portalled elements here, which can still 
      consume the React Context from the Root, but are
      appended to the document */}
    </Player.Portal>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

### `children`

React nodes that are to be rendered inside the portal.

### `container`

An optional prop specifying a container element where the portal's children
should be rendered. If not provided, the children are appended to the body of
the document by default.
