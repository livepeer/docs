<Info>
  The `ClipTrigger` is designed to be used as a child of the `Player` component.
  It interacts with the playback state to provide a user-friendly interface for creating media
  clips, **based on the Unix timestamp from the current playback position**.

_Clipping is currently supported only for livestreams_.

</Info>

## Features

- Automatically handles determining the current playback head in Unix time
- Compatible with the [create clip API](/api-reference/stream/create-clip)
- Keyboard hotkeys and adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) design
  patterns
- Conditional rendering if it is supported by the current media and is enabled

<Warning>
  `ClipTrigger` will automatically handle determining the Unix timestamp for the
  current playback position. The playback position is _not_ the same as the
  server livestream head, due to natural latency from server ingest to playback.
  This is why Unix timestamps are required, and relative timestamps cannot be
  used.
</Warning>

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.LiveIndicator>
        <Player.ClipTrigger />
      </Player.LiveIndicator>
    </Player.Container>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.Controls>
        <Player.LiveIndicator>
          <Player.ClipTrigger />
        </Player.LiveIndicator>
      </Player.Controls>
    </Player.Container>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Usage

`ClipTrigger` is a button that users can interact with to initiate the clip
creation process. It's displayed only if clipping functionality is enabled (by
passing a valid `clipLength` to the Root component).

**It should be wrapped in a LiveIndicator, since the "last n seconds" clipping
functionality is only supported on livestreams.**

## Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element, along with
specific props:

### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for controlling animations with external animation
libraries.

### `onClip`

A function that gets called when a clip is requested. It receives an object
containing the `playbackId`, `startTime`, and `endTime`, which can be used to
handle the clip creation process.

## Data Attributes

The `ClipTrigger` component assigns data attributes to its underlying element to
reflect the current state and user interaction capabilities.

### `data-livepeer-controls-clip-button`

Serves to identify the component's role.

### `data-visible`

Indicates the visibility status of the trigger, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., clip functionality is enabled) and `"false"` denoting
it's not visible, useful for CSS-based animations.
