<Info>
  The `Container` component acts as the container div element for the Player,
  using either
  [@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/aspect-ratio)
  or a standard div element. It selectively renders one of these based on the
  presence of an `aspectRatio` prop. We show above how to disable the aspect
  ratio element.
</Info>

## Features

- Provides an aspect ratio container to reduce
  [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
- Dynamic data attributes for custom styling based on the current media state

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Container>
      {/* Place child elements here, like Video and Controls */}
    </Player.Container>
    {/* Or place other controls outside of here, to not be bound by the aspect ratio Container */}
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Data Attributes

These attributes are dynamically updated based on the current state.

### `data-livepeer-aspect-ratio` or `data-livepeer-wrapper`

Indicates the container type. It's present if the container is an aspect ratio
container (with `data-livepeer-aspect-ratio`) or a regular div (with
`data-livepeer-wrapper`).

<Info>
  When `aspectRatio` is set to `null` on the Root component, then it will be a
  regular div wrapper with `position: relative`.
