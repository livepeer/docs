```tsx
import { getSrc } from "@livepeer/react/external";
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

// An example response from the livepeer playback info API endpoint
const vodSource = {
  type: "vod",
  meta: {
    playbackPolicy: null,
    source: [
      {
        hrn: "HLS (TS)",
        type: "html5/application/vnd.apple.mpegurl",
        url: "https://lp-playback.com/hls/f5eese9wwl88k4g8/index.m3u8",
      },
    ],
  },
};

// This is either an array of `Src` or null,
// and can be passed into the Player.Root `src`
const src = getSrc(vodSource);

export default () => (
  <Player.Root src={src}>{/* All child components. */}</Player.Root>
);
```

#### Features

- Supports inputs like Livepeer playback info, Cloudflare stream data, Mux URLs,
  arrays of strings, and single strings
- Transforms into `Src[]` which contains essential playback information, along
  with supportive metadata like thumbnails and VTT files.

### Functionality

#### Input Types

The function can process the following input types:

- `LivepeerPlaybackInfo`: Extracts the 'source' array from its 'meta' property
  from the playback info endpoint.
- `LivepeerSource` or `LivepeerSource[]`: Uses the source object(s) directly.
- `CloudflareStreamData`: Retrieves the stream data from a Cloudflare stream
  data object.
- `string[]`: Assumes each string as a URL and creates an array of Source
  objects.
- `string`: Assumes the string is a URL and creates a single Source object.

#### Output Format

The output is an array of `Src` objects or `null` if the input is invalid or
empty.
