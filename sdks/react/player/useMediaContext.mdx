<Info>
  The `useStore` hook is from
  [`zustand`](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?tab=readme-ov-file#using-zustand-without-react),
  and inherits all of the documentation for Zustand stores.
</Info>

## Features

- Flexible interaction with the player state store
- Based on Zustand's `useStore` hooks

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";
import { useMediaContext, useStore } from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    {/** The `useMediaContext` hook can be used in any component,
    as long as it's inside the Player.Root React Context provider */}
    <CustomComponent />
  </Player.Root>
);

function CustomComponent({ __scopeMedia }: MediaScopedProps) {
  const context = useMediaContext("CustomComponent", __scopeMedia);

  const { currentSource } = useStore(context.store, ({ currentSource }) => ({
    currentSource,
  }));

  return currentSource?.type ?? null;
}
```

## State

The `useMediaContext` hook returns a Zustand store, which contains the
`PlayerState`.

### `aria`

The ARIA text for the current state, providing accessible descriptions for media
control actions.

```tsx
type AriaText = {
  progress: string;
  pictureInPicture: string;
  fullscreen: string;
  playPause: string;
  clip: string | null;
  time: string;
};

aria: AriaText;
```

### `buffered`

Current buffered end time for the media in seconds.

```tsx
buffered: number;
```

### `bufferedPercent`

Current buffered percent of the media, from 0 to 1.

```tsx
bufferedPercent: number;
```

### `canPlay`

Indicates if the media has loaded sufficiently and can be played.

### `currentSource`

The current source that is playing.

```tsx
type Src =
  | AudioSrc
  | HlsSrc
  | VideoSrc
  | Base64Src
  | WebRTCSrc
  | ImageSrc
  | VideoTextTrackSrc;

currentSource: Src | null;
```

### `currentUrl`

The final playback URL for the media that is playing, after any redirects.

```tsx
currentUrl: string | null;
```

### `duration`

Current total duration of the media in seconds.

```tsx
duration: number;
```

### `error`

If the media has experienced an error, this property provides details.

```tsx
type PlaybackError = {
  type: "offline" | "access-control" | "fallback" | "permissions" | "unknown";
  message: string;
};

error: PlaybackError | null;
```

### `errorCount`

The number of consecutive errors that have occurred during the media playback,
without resolution.

```tsx
errorCount: number;
```

### `stalled`

Indicates if the media playback is currently stalled.

### `fullscreen`

Indicates if the media is being played in fullscreen mode.

### `hasPlayed`

Indicates if the media has been played yet.

### `hidden`

Indicates if all controls are currently hidden.

### `live`

Indicates if the content is live media.

### `loading`

Indicates if the media is currently loading.

### `mounted`

Indicates if the video element is mounted on the DOM. This is used for
initialization logic.

### `playbackRate`

The current playback rate for the media. Defaults to 1. `constant` means playing
WebRTC playback at a constant pace and not speeding up.

```tsx
type PlaybackRate = number | "constant";

playbackRate: PlaybackRate;
```

### `pictureInPicture`

Indicates if the media is in picture in picture mode.

### `poster`

The poster image URL for the media. Any thumbnails are automatically parsed from
the input `Src[]`.

```tsx
poster: string | null;
```

### `progress`

Current progress of the media in seconds.

```tsx
progress: number;
```

### `playing`

Indicates if the media is currently trying to play or paused.

### `sortedSources`

The sorted sources that were passed into the Player. These are the playback
sources which will be tried, in order (e.g. WebRTC with a fallback to HLS).

```tsx
sortedSources: Src[] | string | null;
```

### `volume`

Current volume of the media. 0 if it is muted.

```tsx
volume: number;
```

### `waiting`

Indicates if the media is currently waiting for data.

### `videoQuality`

The quality of the video playback.

```tsx
type VideoQuality =
  | "1080p"
  | "720p"
  | "480p"
  | "360p"
  | "240p"
  | "144p"
  | "auto";

videoQuality: VideoQuality;
```

### `ended`

Indicates if the media playback has ended.

### `__controlsFunctions`

An object containing functions to manipulate the media's state, such as toggling
play/pause, seeking, and changing volume.

<Warning>
  These functions are internal - please refer to the UI Kit source code before
  interacting with these functions.
</Warning>

```tsx
__controlsFunctions: {
  setHidden: (hidden: boolean) => void;
  onCanPlay: () => void;
  onDurationChange: (duration: number) => void;
  onEnded: () => void;
  onError: (error: Error | null) => void;
  onFinalUrl: (url: string | null) => void;
  onLoading: () => void;
  onPause: () => void;
  onPlay: () => void;
  onProgress: (time: number) => void;
  onStalled: () => void;
  onWaiting: () => void;
  requestClip: () => void;
  requestMeasure: () => void;
  requestSeek: (time: number) => void;
  requestSeekBack: (difference?: number) => void;
  requestSeekDiff: (difference: number) => void;
  requestSeekForward: (difference?: number) => void;
  requestToggleFullscreen: () => void;
  requestToggleMute: () => void;
  requestTogglePictureInPicture: () => void;
  requestVolume: (volume: number) => void;
  setAutohide: (autohide: number) => void;
  setFullscreen: (fullscreen: boolean) => void;

  setSize: (size: Partial<MediaSizing>) => void;
  setVolume: (volume: number) => void;
  setWebsocketMetadata: (metadata: Metadata) => void;
  togglePlay: (force?: boolean) => void;
  updateBuffered: (buffered: number) => void;
  updateLastInteraction: () => void;
  updatePlaybackOffsetMs: (offset: number) => void;
};
```

### `__device`

Information about the device's capabilities and support for media features. This
is an internal object used by Player/Broadcast, but can be used for detecting
device capabilities.

```tsx
type DeviceInformation = {
  version: string;
  isMobile: boolean;
  isIos: boolean;
  isAndroid: boolean;
  userAgent: string;
  screenWidth: number | null;
  /** If the media supports changing the volume */
  isVolumeChangeSupported: boolean;
  /** If the media supports PiP */
  isPictureInPictureSupported: boolean;
  /** If the media supports fullscreen */
  isFullscreenSupported: boolean;
  /** If the media supports HLS playback */
  isHlsSupported: boolean;
  /** If the media supports WebRTC */
  isWebRTCSupported: boolean;
};

__device: DeviceInformation;
```

### `__controls`

Represents the state of various media control actions, such as play/pause and
fullscreen changes. This is an internal object used by Player/Broadcast.

```tsx
__controls: ControlsState;
```

### `__initialProps`

The initial properties passed into the media component. This is an internal
object used by Player/Broadcast.

```tsx
__initialProps: InitialProps;
```

### `__metadata`

Metadata related to the media, such as buffer window and frame rate. This is an
internal object used by Player/Broadcast.

```tsx
type Metadata = {
  bframes?: number;
  bufferWindow?: number;
};

__metadata: Metadata | null;
```
