## Features

- Automatic conditional rendering based on browser API availability,
  customizable with the `matcher` pattern
- Supports both the [w3c](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) standard
  (which most modern browsers support), as well as the
  [older Safari/iOS spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/adding_picture_in_picture_to_your_safari_media_controls)
  (see the browsers which support Picture-in-Picture on
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/picture-in-picture))

## Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

export default () => (
  <Player.Root>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.PictureInPictureTrigger />
    </Player.Container>
    <Player.Container>
      <Player.Controls>
        <Player.PictureInPictureTrigger />
      </Player.Controls>
    </Player.Container>
  </Player.Root>
);
```

## Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element.

## Data Attributes

### `data-livepeer-controls-picture-in-picture-trigger`

Serves to identify the component's role.

### `data-picture-in-picture`

Indicates the current picture-in-picture state, `"true"` when the feature is
active and `"false"` otherwise.

### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the trigger, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., picture-in-picture is supported and the media is not in
fullscreen mode) and `"false"` denoting it's not visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
