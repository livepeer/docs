<Card title="A warning on the stream's page in the Livepeer Studio UI.">
  Diagnose: This is due to the low latency playback feature using WebRTC. If
  there are bframes in the stream, the default behavior is to fallback to HLS
  playback, which means a slight increase in latency. Workaround: In the
  settings of the broadcaster, turn off the use of frames. If using OBS, select
  Livepeer as the service for the video settings.

<Card title="Streams sometimes have a difficult time reconnecting to the feed and stop.">
  Diagnose: Reconnection: If a stream is down, attempt to retry for that stream
  from other nodes nearby until there is a connection(using Livepeer player)
  Workaround: Implement a retry logic or switch over to the Livepeer player with
  the SDK or iframe embeded player.

<Card title="Is there a way we could update the viewerId and video watch event to livestream / asset through Livepeer API?">
Diagnose: We do not support pagination yet but it is a pending feature. You can use the playbackId as a workaround.
Workaround: A short term workaround could be to "paginate" by playbackId instead.
- First list all playback ids with: `/api/data/views/query?breakdownBy[]=playbackId`
- then viewers by playbackId with `/api/data/views/query?playbackId=<pid>&breakdownBy[]=viewerId`
