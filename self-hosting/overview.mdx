Learn how to self-host Livepeer Studio using a single Docker command.

<Info>
  **Self-hosting is in Alpha**, but we're excited for the first group of hackers
  to start working on it!
</Info>

### Current capabilities:

- Boots up a full-stack Livepeer Studio experience with a single command, either
  locally or on a hosted server.
- Capable of transcoding on the Livepeer Network.
- Allows for development of applications against the Livepeer Studio API locally
  that can then transfer to the hosted version at
  [livepeer.studio](https://livepeer.studio) when you're ready to go to
  production.
- Bundles a fully-local offchain Livepeer gateway and orchestrator, so that you
  may test transcoding with no external dependencies.

### Current limitations:

- No usage or billing data.
- No GPU transcoding support. We recommend using very low-bitrate test files,
  especially if using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows. The built-in
  profiles for livestream transcoding use a single 240p low-quality rendition.
- It is currently required to run Livepeer Studio as a Docker image. A
  single-binary fully-static build is in the works.
