Livepeer Studio is powered by Catalyst, the Livepeer network's first
open-source, decentralized media server. Learn how to self-host Catalyst using a
single Docker command and get the full-stack Livepeer Studio experience running
on your laptop.

<Info>
  **Self-hosted Catalyst is in Alpha**, but we're excited for the first group of
  hackers to start working on it!

### Current capabilities:

- Boots up a full-stack Livepeer Studio experience with a single command, either
  locally or on a hosted server.
- Capable of transcoding on the Livepeer mainnet.
- Facilitates easy development of various components of the Livepeer stack.
- Allows for development of applications against the Livepeer Studio API locally
  that can then transfer to the hosted version at
  [livepeer.studio](https://livepeer.studio) when you're ready to go to
  production.
- Bundles a fully-local offchain go-livepeer gateway and orchestrator, so that
  you may test transcoding with no external dependencies.

### Current limitations:

- No usage or billing data.
- No GPU transcoding support. We recommend using very low-bitrate test files,
  especially if running the box using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows. The
  built-in profiles for livestream transcoding use a single 240p low-quality
  rendition.
- It is currently required to run the node as a Docker image. A single-binary
  fully-static build is in the works.
