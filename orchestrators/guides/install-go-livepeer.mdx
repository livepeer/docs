Depending on your workflow, you may prefer to install `go-livepeer`
using a binary release, a Docker image, or from source.

## Install using a Binary Release

### Recommended

Use the `install.sh` script from the [`go-livepeer` repository](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/install.sh) to get a completely
automated latest release installed onto your system. The script
requires presence of `curl`, `sha256sum` (for checksum verification)
and `gpg` (for signature validation). To install required dependencies
please use the following commands (for popular ubuntu/mac systems):

#### Dependencies

```bash
# For ubuntu
apt install curl coreutils gnupg2

# For macOS
brew install curl coreutils gnupg
```

#### Installation

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/master/install.sh)"
```

Additional steps to install custom release for individual OS are declared below.

### Darwin (macOS)

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.35
# IMPORTANT: if you are using macOS with an M1 chip, you'll need to run these commands using the Rosetta emulator

# Fetch the latest release
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

# Next, extract it
tar -zxvf livepeer-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory
mv livepeer-darwin-amd64/* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.35

# Fetch the latest release
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Next, extract it
tar -zxvf livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory
mv livepeer-linux-amd64/* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

```shell
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.35

# Fetch the latest release .zip
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

# Next, extract it
unzip livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory, e.g. C:\Users\UserName\livepeer-folder
move livepeer-windows-amd64 e.g. C:\Users\UserName\livepeer-folder
```

<Info>
  At this time Livepeer does not provide automatic updates. You can perform a
  manual update or use a script. A community-created [Bash script to update
  Livepeer is available on the livepeer
  Forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/bash-script-to-update-livepeer/1513).
</Info>

### Third-party packages

Packages for different Linux distributions are maintained by Livepeer
community members. Before using these packages, please verify that
they have been updated to use the [latest builds of
go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases). This
list will be updated as a best-effort, but we cannot guarantee if
individual packages are up to date or verify their integrity.

In the future, Livepeer core contributors may publish official
packages for the distributions below.

| Platform   | Installation           | Source                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Arch Linux | `paru go-livepeer-bin` | https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-livepeer-bin/ |

## Install using a Docker image

### Prerequisites

If you do not have Docker installed, you will need to install it using the guide
[here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before running the commands below.

### Installation

With every release, Docker images are pushed to
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/go-livepeer).

If you are running macOS with an M1 chip, you'll need to [run your terminal using the Rosetta emulator](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/428769) and specifically pull the `linux/amd64` release. In the future, we will provide alternative `arm64` builds.

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version i.e. 0.5.14
docker pull livepeer/go-livepeer:<RELEASE_VERSION>

# Mac M1 only
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 livepeer/go-livepeer:<RELEASE_VERSION>
```

### Running livepeer-cli with Docker

Once you've pulled the image, retrieve the image id and start the container.

**Any flags you provide will be passed to the binary**, so you can pass your configuration here.

```bash
docker run <image id> <livepeer configuration flags>

# Mac M1 only
docker run --platform linux/amd64 <image id> <livepeer configuration flags>
```

Once you've started the container, retrieve the name and start the CLI

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> livepeer_cli
```

### Installing pre-releases with Docker

To pull the latest pre-release version:

```bash
docker pull livepeer/go-livepeer:master
```

## Build from source

### System dependencies

Building `livepeer` requires some system dependencies.

#### Linux (Ubuntu: 16.04 or 18.04)

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get -y install build-essential pkg-config autoconf git curl
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu: 20.04)

```bash
apt-get -y install protobuf-compiler-grpc golang-goprotobuf-dev
```

To enable transcoding using Nvidia GPUs on Linux systems

- CUDA must be [installed on the system](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
- `clang` must be installed as well. The script that will install `ffmpeg` dependencies uses `which clang` command to determine whether `clang` is installed or not. Please check this on your system. If the path is empty, please install `clang`. For example on the Ubuntu machine one can do

```bash
apt-get -y install clang clang-tools
```

#### Darwin (macOS)

```bash
brew update && brew install pkg-config autoconf
```

#### Windows

The steps in
[this file](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/.github/workflows/windows.yml)
can be used as a reference.

### Go

Building `livepeer` requires Go. Follow the
[official Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Build and install

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer.git
cd go-livepeer
```

2. Install `ffmpeg` dependencies:

```bash
./install_ffmpeg.sh
```

<Info>
  This is the step that requires `which clang` to return clang path in order to
  build CUDA support, as described above
</Info>

3. Set build environment variables.

Set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable so that `pkg-config` can find the `ffmpeg`
dependency files installed in step 2:

```bash
# install_ffmpeg.sh stores ffmpeg dependency files in this directory by default
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/compiled/lib/pkgconfig
```

Set the `BUILD_TAGS` variable to enable mainnet support:

```bash
export BUILD_TAGS=mainnet
# To build with support for only development networks and the Rinkeby test network
# export BUILD_TAGS=rinkeby
# To build with support for only development networks
# export BUILD_TAGS=dev
```

4. Build and install `livepeer`:

```bash
make
cp livepeer* /usr/local/bin
```

<Info>
  **Mac M1 users**: If you see an error like `ld: symbol(s) not found for
  architecture x86_64`, this is because of a conflict between dependency builds
  and the Livepeer build. You should check that you are using the
  [\*-darwin-arm64 binary](https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.6.darwin-arm64.pkg) instead
  of the `*-darwin-amd64` binary. You can check what Go architecture you're
  using with `go version`.
</Info>

## Build with Docker

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer.git
cd go-livepeer
```

2. Export tags:

```bash
echo $(git describe --tags) > .git.describe
```

3. Build image:

```bash
docker build -t livepeerbinary:debian -f docker/Dockerfile.debian .
```
