description:
  "`getSrc` is a utility function for parsing various types of playback
  information and convert them into a standardized format of `Src` objects
  suitable for the Player."
---

The `getSrc` function is a parser that accepts multiple input types and
processes them into a unified format for the Player.

It supports inputs such as Livepeer playback info, Cloudflare stream data, Mux
URLs, arrays of strings, and single strings, transforming them into `Src`
objects that contain essential playback information along with supportive
metadata like thumbnails and VTT files.

## Overview

### Functionality

`getSrc` is designed to facilitate the integration of different media sources
into the Player by providing a standardized output format.

#### Input Types

The function can process the following input types:

- `LivepeerPlaybackInfo`: Extracts the 'source' array from its 'meta' property
  from the playback info endpoint.
- `LivepeerSource` or `LivepeerSource[]`: Uses the source object(s) directly.
- `CloudflareStreamData`: Retrieves the stream data from a Cloudflare stream
  data object.
- `string[]`: Assumes each string as a URL and creates an array of Source
  objects.
- `string`: Assumes the string is a URL and creates a single Source object.

#### Output Format

The output is an array of `Src` objects or `null` if the input is invalid or
empty.

### Usage

The function is typically used in scenarios where different types of media
sources need to be parsed and provided to a media player in a standardized
format.

### Implementation

```tsx
const srcObjects = getSrc(playbackInfo);
```

In this example, `playbackInfo` can be any supported type of media source
information. The function processes this input and returns an array of `Src`
objects, which can then be used by the Player for media playback.
