  "The `RateSelect` and `RateSelectItem` components provide an interface for
  users to adjust the playback speed of the media."
---

The `RateSelect` and `RateSelectItem` components offer an interactive dropdown
to choose the playback speed and individual selectable options. They provide a
straightforward way for users to control the speed at which the media is played.

## Introduction

### `RateSelect`

`RateSelect` acts as a dropdown menu, allowing users to select different
playback rates. It reflects the current playback rate and updates it based on
the user's selection.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a dropdown element. It also manages
the current playback rate and updates it as per user interaction.

### `RateSelectItem`

`RateSelectItem` represents an individual option within the `RateSelect`
dropdown. Each item corresponds to a specific playback rate, allowing users to
choose from various speeds.

#### Props

The component accepts props appropriate for a dropdown item element.

It requires a `value` prop representing the numerical value of the playback rate
or `constant` for a fixed playback rate.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `RateSelect` and `RateSelectItem`
components might be used within the Player:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";
import { CheckIcon, ChevronDownIcon } from "lucide-react";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root playbackRate={0.5}>
      <Player.RateSelect name="speedSelect">
        <Player.SelectTrigger aria-label="Playback speed">
          <Player.SelectValue placeholder="Select a speed..." />
          <Player.SelectIcon>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Player.SelectIcon>
        </Player.SelectTrigger>
        <Player.SelectPortal>
          <Player.SelectContent className="overflow-hidden bg-black rounded-sm">
            <Player.SelectViewport className="p-1">
              <Player.SelectGroup>
                <RateSelectItem value={0.5}>0.5x</RateSelectItem>
                <RateSelectItem value={1}>1x (normal)</RateSelectItem>
                <RateSelectItem value={1.5}>1.5x</RateSelectItem>
                <RateSelectItem value={2}>2x</RateSelectItem>
              </Player.SelectGroup>
            </Player.SelectViewport>
          </Player.SelectContent>
        </Player.SelectPortal>
      </Player.RateSelect>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}

const RateSelectItem = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  Player.RateSelectItemProps
>(({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
  return (
    <Player.RateSelectItem {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
      <Player.SelectItemText>{children}</Player.SelectItemText>
      <Player.SelectItemIndicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Player.SelectItemIndicator>
    </Player.RateSelectItem>
  );
});
```

In this example, `RateSelect` and `RateSelectItem`, along with the generic
`Select*` components, are used to build a dropdown menu with options for
playback rates, allowing users to choose between 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x speeds.

## Data Attributes

Both components assign data attributes to their underlying elements to reflect
the current state and user interactions.

### `RateSelect`

#### `data-livepeer-rate-select`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-rate`

Indicates the current playback rate, e.g., `"1.00"` for normal speed.

### `RateSelectItem`

#### `data-livepeer-rate-select-item`

Identifies the component's role within the `RateSelect`.
