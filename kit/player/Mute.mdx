The `MuteTrigger` is an essential part of the media playback controls, offering
an intuitive mechanism for users to mute or unmute the audio. This React
component enhances the user interaction with the media player by providing a
clear and accessible mute button.

## Introduction

### `MuteTrigger`

`MuteTrigger` acts as a button for toggling the mute state of the media.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element, ensuring full
compatibility and flexibility for styling and interaction handling.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `MuteTrigger` component might be used
within the Player:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root>
      <Player.MuteTrigger>Toggle Mute</Player.MuteTrigger>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `MuteTrigger` allows users to easily mute or unmute the
media.

## Data Attributes

The `MuteTrigger` component assigns data attributes to its underlying element to
indicate the current mute state and provide hooks for styling or scripting.

#### `data-livepeer-controls-mute-trigger`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-muted`

Indicates the current mute state, `"true"` when the audio is muted and `"false"`
when it's not.
