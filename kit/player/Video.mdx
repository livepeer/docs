  video content and managing various aspects of media playback."

The `Video` component is responsible for rendering the video content and
handling media source changes, playback, and other key functionalities.

## Introduction

### `Video`

`Video` displays the video content within the Player. It manages not only the
display of the video but also the interaction with the media source, autoplay
settings, preload configurations, and poster image handling.

#### Props

The component accepts most props suitable for a video tag, except for `src`,
`poster`, `autoPlay`, and `preload`, which are managed internally or provided
explicitly through props:

##### `poster`

Optional. Controls the poster source. By default, it uses the thumbnail from the
`Root` src input. Set to `null` to disable the default poster image from the
`Root` src.

##### `hlsConfig`

Optional. Controls the HLS.js config. By default, it adds JWT or Access Token
headers to HLS segment requests.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Video` component might be used within
the Player:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root>
      <Player.Video poster={null} />
      {/* Additional Player components like Controls, Seek, etc. */}
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, `Video` is responsible for rendering the video content and
overriding the default poster element to force it to not show.

## Data Attributes

The `Video` component assigns data attributes to its underlying element to
reflect the current source type and other relevant states.

### `Video`

#### `data-livepeer-video`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-livepeer-source-type`

Indicates the type of the current source, such as "none" when there's no source,
or other types based on the media being played.

This can be of the type: `"audio" | "video" | "hls" | "webrtc" | "none"`
