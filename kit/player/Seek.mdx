  "The `Seek` and `SeekBuffer` components provide interactive and visual
  elements for seeking through media and displaying buffer status."
---

The `Seek` and `SeekBuffer` components play a crucial role in the Player's media
control interface. `Seek` offers an interactive slider for users to navigate
through the media, while `SeekBuffer` provides a visual representation of the
buffered content. These React components use `@radix-ui/react-presence` for
conditional rendering, ensuring accurate representation based on the current
playback and buffer state.

## Introduction

### `Seek`

`Seek` acts as an interactive slider, allowing users to navigate through the
media content. It is displayed only when the media is not live, providing a
precise control mechanism for seeking specific points in the media timeline.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a slider element, along with
specific props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

### `SeekBuffer`

`SeekBuffer` provides a visual indicator of the portion of media that has been
buffered. It's integrated within the `Seek` slider to offer users a visual
understanding of the buffer status in relation to the playback progress.

#### Props

The component accepts all props appropriate for a track element within a slider.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Seek` and `SeekBuffer` components might
be used within the Player:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root>
      <Player.Seek>
        <Player.Track>
          <Player.SeekBuffer />
          <Player.Range />
        </Player.Track>
        <Player.Thumb />
      </Player.Seek>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, `Seek` provides a slider for navigating through the media, and
`SeekBuffer` displays the buffered content within the `Seek` slider.

## Data Attributes

Both components assign several data attributes to their underlying elements to
reflect the current state, user interactions, and visibility conditions.

### `Seek`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-seek`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-duration`

Indicates the total duration of the media.

#### `data-progress`

Shows the current progress as a percentage of the total duration.

#### `data-live`

Indicates if the current media is live, `"true"` for live and `"false"` for
non-live media.

#### `data-buffered`

Shows the portion of the media that has been buffered.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the slider, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., the media is not live) and `"false"` denoting it's not
visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.

### `SeekBuffer`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-seek-buffer`

Identifies the component's role within the Seek slider.

#### `data-buffered`

Shows the portion of the media that has been buffered.
