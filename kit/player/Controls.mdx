  "The `Controls` component provides an interactive interface for media control
  actions such as play, pause, and more."
---

The `Controls` offers a user-friendly interface for showing and hiding the
controls elements. This React component utilizes `@radix-ui/react-presence` for
conditional rendering, ensuring it is displayed properly based on the current
media state, device capabilities, and user interactions.

## Introduction

### `Controls`

`Controls` serves as the interactive layer for media control actions. It is
dynamically displayed based on certain conditions like the media state, loading
state, or if an error is present.

By default, it is shown when a user hovers over or interacts with the Container
element, similar to how controls are usually shown for most media players.

It is automatically hidden after a user interaction based on the `Root`
component's `autohide` property.

#### Props

The component accepts all props appropriate for a div element, along with
specific props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

##### `autoHide`

Optional. Sets the time to wait (in milliseconds) to auto-hide controls after a
user interaction, like mouse or touch event. Defaults to 3000. Set to 0 for no
hiding.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Controls` component might be used
within the Player:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root>
      <Player.Controls>
        {/* Interactive control elements like play/pause button, progress bar, etc. */}
      </Player.Controls>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

`Controls` provides an interactive layer within the Player, where various
control elements like play/pause buttons, progress bars, etc., can be placed.

## Data Attributes

The `Controls` component assigns several data attributes to its underlying
element to reflect the current state, user interactions, and visibility
conditions.

#### `data-livepeer-controls`

Serves to identify the component's role within the Player.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the controls, with `"true"` meaning they're
currently visible (not hidden, not loading, and no error present) and `"false"`
denoting they're not visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
