The `ClipTrigger` component is a specialized feature in the media playback
controls, designed specifically for creating clips from live media content. It's
a React component that employs `@radix-ui/react-presence` for conditional
rendering.

<Info>
  The `ClipTrigger` is designed to be used as a child of the `Player` component.
  It interacts with the playback state to provide a user-friendly interface for creating media clips.

_Clipping is currently supported only for livestreams_.

## Introduction

### `ClipTrigger`

`ClipTrigger` is a button that users can interact with to initiate the clip
creation process. It's displayed only if clipping functionality is enabled (by
passing a valid `clipLength` to the Root component).

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element, along with
specific props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for controlling animations with external animation
libraries.

##### `onClip`

A function that gets called when a clip is requested. It receives an object
containing the `playbackId`, `startTime`, and `endTime`, which can be used to
handle the clip creation process.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `ClipTrigger` component might be used:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function ClipComponent() {
  const handleClip = async ({ playbackId, startTime, endTime }) => {
    // Handle clip creation logic here with an API call from your backend
    // Make sure to sanitize the arguments on your backend, to make sure users
    // create clips within your application bounds.
  };

  return (
    <Player.Root clipLength={30}>
      <Player.ClipTrigger onClip={handleClip}>Create Clip</Player.ClipTrigger>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `ClipTrigger` provides a button that, when clicked,
initiates the clip creation process using the `handleClip` function.

## Data Attributes

The `ClipTrigger` component assigns data attributes to its underlying element to
reflect the current state and user interaction capabilities.

#### `data-livepeer-controls-clip-button`

Serves to identify the component's role.

#### `data-visible`

Indicates the visibility status of the trigger, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., clip functionality is enabled) and `"false"` denoting
it's not visible.
