The `Video` component is a container for previewing broadcast video content.
This React component is adds event listeners to keep the store in sync with the
video element state.

## Introduction

### `Video`

`Video` serves as the visual display area for the media content. It can interact
with user media devices when permission is granted and reflects the enabled
state of the broadcast.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a video element, with specific
behavior for the following props:

##### `enableUserMedia`

A boolean indicating whether the component should request permissions for
video/audio input from the user. Defaulting to `true`, it prompts the user for
access to their microphone and camera upon component mount. This can be
controlled to determine the timing of the permissions request.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Video` component might be used within
the broadcast or media playback interface:

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

function BroadcastComponent() {
  return (
    <Broadcast.Root>
      <Broadcast.Video />
    </Broadcast.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, `Video` acts as the container for the broadcast content,
requesting user media permissions upon mount and adapting its size to fill its
container.

## Data Attributes

The `Video` component assigns data attributes to its underlying element to
reflect the current state and facilitate styling and scripting.

### `Video`

#### `data-livepeer-video`

Serves to identify the component's role within the broadcast or media playback
interface.

#### `data-enabled`

Indicates the enabled state of the broadcast, `"true"` when broadcasting is
enabled and `"false"` when it is not.
