---

The `Broadcast.Root` component is a React Context wrapper that provides the
broadcasting state store to all its child components. It creates a
[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) store that handles browser events
and maintains state synchronization.

## Usage

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

function BroadcastComponent() {
  return <Broadcast.Root ingestUrl={getIngest(streamKey)}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>;
}
```

## Configuration

### `ingestUrl`

Configures the WHIP WebRTC ingest URL for the `Broadcast` component. You can
create the `ingestUrl` by passing [`getIngest`](/kit/broadcast/get-ingest) a
string (interpreted as a Livepeer Studio stream key or URL), Livepeer Studio
stream data, or Cloudflare stream data. `Broadcast` is compatible with all WHIP
playback endpoints.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root ingestUrl={getIngest(streamKey)}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `aspectRatio`

Specifies the aspect ratio of the content. Recommended for an optimal
broadcasting experience to minimize
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The default value is `16 / 9`.

Set to `null` to disable the aspect ratio container (see `Container`).

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root aspectRatio={16 / 9}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `forceEnabled`

Determines whether the WebRTC stream should start immediately after the user
allows access to their video/audio input. The default is `false`, which previews
the video first, then streams media to the server upon activation.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root forceEnabled={true}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `audio`

Controls whether audio is enabled initially for the broadcast. The default is
`true`. Set to `false` to start the broadcast without requesting an audio track.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root audio={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `video`

Controls whether video is enabled initially for the broadcast. The default is
`true`. Set to `false` to start the broadcast without requesting a video track.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root video={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `hotkeys`

Enables keyboard hotkeys for controlling the broadcast. Enabled by default
(`true`). It's recommended to follow ARIA guidelines by keeping this enabled
unless you're implementing custom hotkeys or there's a conflict with existing
ones.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root hotkeys={false}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `creatorId`

Sets the creator ID for the broadcast, useful for metrics and viewership API
integration.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root creatorId="creator123">{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `onError`

An optional callback for handling broadcasting errors. It's called with `null`
when the previous error is resolved. The callback receives the parameter:

```ts
type PlaybackError = {
  type: "offline" | "access-control" | "fallback" | "permissions" | "unknown";
  message: string;
};
```

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root onError={(error) => console.log(error)}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `timeout`

Sets the timeout duration for playback before switching to the next source,
including SDP negotiation for WebRTC, waiting for WebRTC to play, and server
responses. The default is 10000 milliseconds.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root timeout={15000}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

### `storage`

Configures the storage option for saving persistent states like volume and video
quality. The default is `localStorage` in the browser. Set to `null` to disable
storage.

```tsx
<Broadcast.Root storage={null}>{...}</Broadcast.Root>
```

## Technical Details

### WebRTC Broadcasting

The Broadcast component utilizes WebRTC for streaming and consistently employs
STUN/TURN servers for the WebRTC connection. This setup facilitates broadcasting
despite corporate firewalls or port restrictions. The component adheres to
WHIP/WHEP standards for ingest/egress SDP negotiation, making it compatible with
any WHIP/WHEP ingest endpoint.
