  "The `StatusIndicator` component provides visual cues for the broadcast
  status."
---

The `StatusIndicator` component is a crucial element within the broadcast
interface, offering a visual representation of the current broadcast status.
This React component uses `@radix-ui/react-presence` for conditional rendering.

## Introduction

### `StatusIndicator`

`StatusIndicator` acts as a visual cue, displaying the current state of the
broadcast, such as live, pending, or idle. It is designed to provide
broadcasters with immediate feedback on the stream's status, enhancing the
control and management of live broadcasts.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a span element, along with specific
props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, ensures the component is always mounted. This is
particularly useful for managing animations with external animation libraries.

##### `matcher`

A prop required to define the conditions under which the `StatusIndicator`
should be visible. It can be a specific `BroadcastStatus` value or a function
that provides custom logic for visibility determination based on the broadcast
status.

The status can be of the type: `"live" | "pending" | "idle"`

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `StatusIndicator` component might be
used within the broadcast interface:

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

function BroadcastComponent() {
  return (
    <Broadcast.Root>
      <Broadcast.StatusIndicator matcher="live">
        {/* Visual cue indicating live status */}
      </Broadcast.StatusIndicator>
      <Broadcast.StatusIndicator matcher="pending">
        {/* Visual cue indicating pending status */}
      </Broadcast.StatusIndicator>
    </Broadcast.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, `StatusIndicator` displays visual cues based on the broadcast's
current status, such as live or pending, providing critical information at a
glance.

## Data Attributes

The `StatusIndicator` component assigns several data attributes to its
underlying element to reflect the current state, enhancing CSS styling and
JavaScript interaction.

### `StatusIndicator`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-status-indicator`

Serves to identify the component's role within the broadcast interface.

#### `data-status`

Shows the current broadcast status as a string.

The status can be of the type: `"live" | "pending" | "idle"`

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible based on the `matcher` or broadcast status and `"false"`
denoting it's not visible.
