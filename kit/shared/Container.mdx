  "The `Container` component is the container div element for both content and
  Player."
---

The `Container` component acts as the container div element for content and
Player, serving as either an aspect ratio container, utilizing
[Aspect Ratio from Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/aspect-ratio),
or a standard div element enhanced with data selector properties.

## Introduction

`Container` is a React component that uses the state store. It selectively
renders as a Radix Aspect Ratio container or a standard div based on the
presence of an `aspectRatio` prop.

The container is passed various `data-*` attributes reflecting the current state
of the content, such as playback status, fullscreen mode, and video quality.
These attributes are derived from the content's state and can be used for
dynamic styling.

### Props

The component accepts all props for a div element. These props are forwarded to
the underlying div or Aspect Ratio container.

### Usage

Here is a generalized usage example of the `Container` component:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Broadcast.tsx">
    ```tsx
    import * as content from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

    function BroadcastComponent() {
      return (
        <Broadcast.Root ingestUrl={getIngest(streamKey)}>
          <Broadcast.Container>{/* Control components */}</Broadcast.Container>
        </Broadcast.Root>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Player.tsx">
  ```tsx
    import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

    function PlayerComponent() {
      return (
        <Player.Root src={getSrc(source)}>
          <Player.Container>{/* Control components */}</Player.Container>
        </Player.Root>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The component can be used within your content or player, wrapping other controls
components.

## Data Attributes

`Container` has a series of data attributes that reflect the store's current
state:

#### `data-livepeer-aspect-ratio` or `data-livepeer-wrapper`

Indicates the container type. It's present if the container is an aspect ratio
container (with `data-livepeer-aspect-ratio`) or a regular div (with
`data-livepeer-wrapper`).

When `aspectRatio` is set to null on the Root component, then it will be a
regular div wrapper with `position: relative`.

#### `data-fullscreen`

Reflects whether the content is in fullscreen mode.

- `"true"`: The content is in fullscreen mode.
- `"false"`: The content is not in fullscreen mode.

#### `data-playing`

Indicates if the content is currently playing.

- `"true"`: The content is playing.
- `"false"`: The content is not playing.

#### `data-can-play`

Shows if the content can be played.

- `"true"`: The content can be played.
- `"false"`: The content cannot be played due to some restrictions or lack of
  data.

#### `data-playback-rate`

Displays the current playback rate.

- `"normal"`: The playback is at normal speed.
- `"fast"`: The playback is at a speed faster than normal.
- `"slow"`: The playback is at a speed slower than normal.
- `"constant"`: The playback rate is constant (neither fast nor slow).

#### `data-error`

Indicates if there is an error in the content.

- `"true"`: There is an error in the content.
- `"false"`: There are no errors in the content.

#### `data-loading`

Shows if the content is loading.

- `"true"`: The content is loading.
- `"false"`: The content is not loading.

#### `data-live`

Indicates if the content is live.

- `"true"`: The content is live.
- `"false"`: The content is not live.

#### `data-has-played`

Reflects if the content has been played.

- `"true"`: The content has been played at least once.
- `"false"`: The content has not been played yet.

#### `data-controls-hidden`

Shows if the controls are hidden.

- `"true"`: The controls are hidden.
- `"false"`: The controls are visible.

#### `data-picture-in-picture`

Indicates if the picture-in-picture mode is active.

- `"true"`: The picture-in-picture mode is active.
- `"false"`: The picture-in-picture mode is not active.

#### `data-video-quality`

Displays the current video quality, directly reflecting the `videoQuality` value
from the state. It can be a string indicating the quality level (e.g., `"720p"`,
`"1080p"`).

These attributes are dynamically updated based on the current state.
