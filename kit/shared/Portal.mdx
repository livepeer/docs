  "The `Portal` component is a fundamental part of the UI rendering
  architecture, allowing for the seamless projection of content into different
  parts of the DOM."

The `Portal` component is a crucial element in UI development, offering a
streamlined approach to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the
DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It leverages `@radix-ui/react-portal`.

## Introduction

### `Portal`

`Portal` enables developers to render components or elements in a different part
of the DOM than their parent components. This is particularly useful for modals,
dropdowns, or any UI elements that need to break out of their parent container
to avoid issues like overflow or z-index problems.

#### Props

The component accepts the following props:

##### `children`

React nodes that are to be rendered inside the portal.

##### `container`

An optional prop specifying a container element where the portal's children
should be rendered. If not provided, the children are appended to the body of
the document by default.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Portal` component might be used:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function ModalComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Portal>
      <div className="modal">This is a modal, rendered using Portal.</div>
    </Player.Portal>
  );
}
```
