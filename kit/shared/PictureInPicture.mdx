---

The `PictureInPictureTrigger` component is an essential feature of the media
playback controls, designed to enable users to toggle the picture-in-picture
mode effortlessly. This React component makes use of `@radix-ui/react-presence`
for conditional rendering, ensuring it is displayed appropriately based on the
current media state and device capabilities.

<Info>
  Kit's Picture in Picture supports both the
  [w3c](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) standard (which most modern
  browsers support), as well as the [older Safari/iOS
  spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/adding_picture_in_picture_to_your_safari_media_controls).
  See the browsers which support Picture-in-Picture on
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/picture-in-picture).

## Introduction

### `PictureInPictureTrigger`

`PictureInPictureTrigger` acts as a button, allowing users to switch between
normal viewing and picture-in-picture mode. It is intelligently displayed only
when the feature is supported by the device and the media is not in fullscreen
mode.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element. It also includes
a `forceMount` prop:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted. This
is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `PictureInPictureTrigger` component
might be used:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function PictureInPictureComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.PictureInPictureTrigger>
      Toggle Picture in Picture
    </Player.PictureInPictureTrigger>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `PictureInPictureTrigger` provides a button that users can
click to toggle the picture-in-picture mode.

## Data Attributes

The `PictureInPictureTrigger` component assigns several data attributes to its
underlying element to reflect the current state and user interaction
possibilities.

#### `data-livepeer-controls-picture-in-picture-trigger`

Serves to identify the component's role.

#### `data-picture-in-picture`

Indicates the current picture-in-picture state, `"true"` when the feature is
active and `"false"` otherwise.

#### `data-visible`

Reflects the visibility status of the trigger, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible (i.e., picture-in-picture is supported and the media is not in
fullscreen mode) and `"false"` denoting it's not visible.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
