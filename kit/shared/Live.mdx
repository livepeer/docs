---

The `LiveIndicator` component is a fundamental part of the media playback
controls, designed to provide a visual representation of the live state of the
media. It's a React component that leverages `@radix-ui/react-presence` for
conditional rendering based on the live state of the media.

## Introduction

`LiveIndicator` visually indicates whether the media is being streamed live. It
can be configured to be always present in the DOM or to display only when
certain conditions, defined by the `matcher` prop, are met.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a span element, along with specific
props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, keeps the component mounted at all times. This is
useful for controlling animations with external libraries.

##### `matcher`

A prop to define the condition under which the `LiveIndicator` should be
visible. It can be a boolean directly matching the live state or a function
providing custom logic to determine visibility.

### Usage

Here's a generalized usage example of the `LiveIndicator` component:

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

function LiveComponent() {
  return (
    <Broadcast.LiveIndicator matcher={true}>
      LIVE
    </Broadcast.LiveIndicator>

    <Broadcast.LiveIndicator matcher={false}>
      PREVIEW
    </Broadcast.LiveIndicator>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `LiveIndicator` renders icons conditionally based on the
live state.

## Data Attributes

The `LiveIndicator` component sets several data attributes on its underlying
element to reflect the current state.

#### `data-livepeer-controls-live-indicator`

Indicates the component's role.

#### `data-live`

Shows the current live state (`"true"` for live streams, `"false"` for assets).

#### `data-visible`

Reflects whether the indicator is currently visible (`"true"` or `"false"`).

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
