---

The `FullscreenIndicator` and `FullscreenTrigger` components are essential parts
of the media playback controls, designed to interact with the fullscreen state
of the media. `FullscreenIndicator` provides a visual representation of the
fullscreen state, while `FullscreenTrigger` offers an interactive button to
toggle this state.

## Introduction

### `FullscreenIndicator`

`FullscreenIndicator` is a React component that visually indicates the
fullscreen state of the media. It leverages `@radix-ui/react-presence` for
conditional rendering based on the fullscreen state.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a div element, along with specific
props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean that, when true, keeps the component mounted at all times, useful for
controlling animations with external libraries.

##### `matcher`

A prop to define the condition under which the `FullscreenIndicator` should be
visible. It can be a boolean directly matching the fullscreen state or a
function providing custom logic to determine visibility.

### `FullscreenTrigger`

`FullscreenTrigger` is a React component acting as a button to toggle the
fullscreen state. It integrates with the media context to reflect and control
the current fullscreen state.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a button element. Additional state
and behavior are derived from the media context.

### Usage

Here's a generalized usage example of the `FullscreenIndicator` and
`FullscreenTrigger` components:

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";
import {
  EnterFullscreenIcon,
  ExitFullscreenIcon,
} from "@livepeer/react/assets";

function FullscreenComponent() {
  return (
    <Broadcast.Root>
      <Broadcast.FullscreenTrigger>
        <Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator asChild>
          <ExitFullscreenIcon />
        </Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator>

        <Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator matcher={false} asChild>
          <EnterFullscreenIcon />
        </Broadcast.FullscreenIndicator>
      </Broadcast.FullscreenTrigger>
    </Broadcast.Root>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `FullscreenIndicator` renders icons conditionally based on
the fullscreen state, and `FullscreenTrigger` wraps as a button to toggle this
state.

## Data Attributes

Both components set several data attributes on their underlying elements to
reflect the current state and provide hooks for CSS styling or JavaScript
interaction.

### `FullscreenIndicator`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-fullscreen-indicator`

Indicates the component's role.

#### `data-fullscreen`

Shows the current fullscreen state (`"true"` or `"false"`).

#### `data-visible`

Reflects whether the indicator is currently visible (`"true"` or `"false"`).

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.

### `FullscreenTrigger`

#### `data-livepeer-controls-fullscreen-trigger`

Indicates the component's role.

#### `data-fullscreen-state`

Shows the current fullscreen state (`"true"` or `"false"`).
