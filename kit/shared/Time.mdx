The `Time` component is designed to provide users with precise information about
the playback time.

## Introduction

### `Time`

`Time` acts as an informative display, presenting users with the current
playback time, total duration, and the progress of the media.

#### Props

The component accepts all props suitable for a span element, ensuring a wide
range of HTML attributes can be applied for customization and accessibility
enhancement.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `Time` component might be used:

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function TimeComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.LiveIndicator matcher={false}>
      <Player.Time />
    </Player.LiveIndicator>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Time` component is rendered to present the current
playback time, total duration, and progress, all of which are crucial for a
user-friendly media playback experience. It is only rendered when the media is
not live (and there is a total duration and progress).

## Data Attributes

The `Time` component assigns several data attributes to its underlying element.

#### `data-livepeer-controls-time`

Serves to identify the component's role in the playback interface.

#### `data-duration`

Displays the total duration of the media.

#### `data-progress`

Indicates the current progress of the media playback, usually represented as a
percentage or time elapsed.

#### `data-live`

Shows the live state of the media, `"true"` for live streams and `"false"` for
pre-recorded content.
