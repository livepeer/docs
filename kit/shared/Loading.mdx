  "The `LoadingIndicator` component is a pivotal element in the media playback
  interface, providing a clear visual signal for the loading state of the media."
---

The `LoadingIndicator` component forms an integral part of the media playback
controls, aimed at visually representing the loading state of the media. As a
React component, it utilizes `@radix-ui/react-presence` for conditional
rendering aligned with the loading state of the media.

## Introduction

### `LoadingIndicator`

`LoadingIndicator` offers a visual cue to indicate whether the media is in the
process of loading. It can be persistently present in the DOM or configured to
appear only under certain conditions, as determined by the `matcher` prop.

#### Props

The component accepts all props appropriate for a div element, along with
specific props:

##### `forceMount`

A boolean value that, when set to true, ensures the component is always mounted.
This is particularly useful for managing animations with external animation
libraries.

##### `matcher`

A prop intended to define the circumstances under which the `LoadingIndicator`
should be visible. It can be a direct boolean comparison with the loading state
or a function that provides custom logic for visibility determination.

### Usage

Here's a generalized example of how the `LoadingIndicator` component might be
used:

```tsx
import * as Broadcast from "@livepeer/react/broadcast";

function LoadingComponent() {
  return (
    <Broadcast.LoadingIndicator matcher={true}>
      LOADING...
    </Broadcast.LoadingIndicator>

    <Broadcast.LoadingIndicator matcher={false}>
      CONTENT READY
    </Broadcast.LoadingIndicator>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `LoadingIndicator` conditionally renders content based on
the loading state.

## Data Attributes

The `LoadingIndicator` component assigns several data attributes to its
underlying element, reflecting the current state.

#### `data-livepeer-loading-indicator`

Serves to identify the component's role.

#### `data-loading`

Displays the current loading state, `"true"` when media is loading and `"false"`
when it's not.

#### `data-visible`

Indicates the visibility status of the indicator, with `"true"` meaning it's
currently visible and `"false"` denoting it's not.

This is often used for dynamically applying enter/exit CSS animations.
