Catalyst is Livepeer's open-source, decentralized media server. It's built from
the same software stack that backs the Livepeer Studio hosted platform.

**Self-hosted Catalyst is in Alpha**, but we're excited for the first group of
hackers to start working on it!

### Current capabilities:

- Boots up a full-stack Livepeer experience on your laptop with a single
  command.
- Facilitates easy development of various components of the Livepeer stack.
- Allows for development of applications against the Livepeer Studio API locally
  that can then transfer to the hosted version at
  [livepeer.studio](https://livepeer.studio) when you're ready to go to
  production.
- Bundles a fully-local offchain go-livepeer broadcaster and orchestrator, so
  that you may test transcoding with no external dependencie.s

### Current limitations:

- There is no way to allow for easy deployment to a server. There are presently
  many hardcoded references to `localhost`, and these things will break in any
  other environment.
- No usage or billing data.
- No GPU transcoding support. We recommend using very low-bitrate test files,
  especially if running the box using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows. The
  built-in profiles for livestream transcoding use a single 240p low-quality
  rendition.
- It is currently required to run the node as a Docker image. A single-binary
  fully-static build is in the works.
