Developing Catalyst is currently supported on macOS and Linux.

### Dependencies

You'll need the following things installed locally:

- Docker (or Podman 4.6.0+, which works even better)
- Buildah (for `docker buildx`, included with Podman and Docker for Mac)
- Go v1.20+
- Node.js v18+ (Studio development only)
- Make
- git
- llvm (`brew install llvm` for compiling MistServer and go-livepeer on MacOS
  only)

You'll first need to clone the Catalyst repo if you haven't already.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livepeer/catalyst.git
cd catalyst
```

Then you'll need to download/build all the binaries that you'll need.

```shell
make              # downloads all the external binaries & builds the local ones
make box          # builds the livepeer/in-a-box Docker image
```

## Development

Now you're ready to boot up your development environment!

```shell
make box-dev
```

Lots and lots of logs will print out while all the dependencies finish booting
up. After that, you'll now have a fully-functioning full-stack Livepeer Studio +
Catalyst environment running locally! You can access it like so:

- URL: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `livepeer`

### Customizing the Environment

If you need to add additional parameters to things running inside the box, you
can create a `.env` file that contains key-value pairs:

```shell
echo "CATALYST_API_CDN_REDIRECT_PREFIX=https://externalcdn.livepeer.com/mist/" >> .env
echo "CATALYST_API_CDN_REDIRECT_PLAYBACK_IDS=222222222222" >> .env
```

Note that this mechanism is limited to adding new configuration; existing
configuration cannot be modified this way. If you need to modify existing
configuration you can manually change the file in `config/full-stack.json`. A
more robust configuration management system is under development.

### Making changes

TLDR: Use a command like this and the Makefile will take care of it for you:

```shell
make livepeer-catalyst-api
```

The general Livepeer in a Box development cycle works like this:

1. Make changes to code on your local filesystem
2. Build a Linux binary from that code
3. Move that Linux binary into the `bin` directory of `catalyst`, which is
   mounted by `make box-dev`
4. Kill the old version of your binary and allow MistController to bring it back
   up.

Thankfully, this entire process has been automated. All you need to do is have
the project you're working on cloned in a directory adjacent to `catalyst`. For
example, if you're hacking on `task-runner`, you might have

```
/home/user/code/catalyst
/home/user/code/task-runner
```

The catalyst Makefile is aware of the common paths for all of the other projects
that go into the full stack. All that's necessary to build a new binary, package
it in the container, and trigger a restart is a single command:

```shell
make livepeer-task-runner
```

Note that the names of all subprojects are prefixed with `livepeer`, just like
the resulting binaries within the Catalyst container. This yields the following
commands:

| Project                     | Command                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [catalyst-api]              | `make livepeer-catalyst-api`      |
| [catalyst-uploader]         | `make livepeer-catalyst-uploader` |
| [task-runner]               | `make livepeer-task-runner`       |
| [analyzer]                  | `make livepeer-analyzer`          |
| [Studio Node.js API Server] | `make livepeer-api`               |
| [MistServer]                | `make mistserver`                 |

### Connecting the Frontend

Livepeer in a Box comes with a [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg)-bundled
version of the Livepeer Studio API server and frontend, but does not include a
full development environment for that frontend. If you are making changes to the
frontend, you can boot it up as you usually would:

```
cd studio/packages/www
yarn run dev
```

To connect it to the box; there's a hidden `localStorage` variable you can use
to override the API server URL. Open your browser console and type in the
following:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("LP_API_SERVER_OVERRIDE", "http://localhost:8888");
```

Reload the page and your frontend should be connecting to the box as an API
server.

Additional note: in the interest of build speed, `make livepeer-api` does not
package the frontend within the `livepeer-api` binary that it builds, so if you
experience your frontend suddenly 404ing after you run `make livepeer-api` you
will have to use the above instructions to boot up the frontend on your host.

You can also build the full API server with a bundled frontend using
`make livepeer-api-pkg`, but be aware this frequently takes 3-4 minutes to
complete.

### Notes

- Your CockroachDB (Postgres) database and your Minio (S3) object store will be
  saved in the `data` subdirectory of your Catalyst installation. If you want to
  start from scratch again with the `admin@example.com` database snapshot, shut
  down your box and `rm -rf data`.
- You can press `Ctrl+C` to trigger a graceful shutdown of the container. If
  you're impatient, following it up with a `Ctrl+\` can uncleanly shut things
  down a bit more cleanly.
- Sometimes the rate of logs produced by Catalyst somehow overwhelms Make and
  log output simply stops. You'll know if you get in this state because you'll
  press Ctrl+C and control will return immediately to your terminal instead of
  shutting down the Docker image. You can start everything back up with
  `docker rm -f catalyst` and `make box-dev`.

## Changelog

### 2023-08-12

- Changed the hardcoded streams in the database snapshots to have
  easy-to-remember stream keys like `2222-2222-2222-2222`
- Changed the built-in streams to use the H264ConstrainedHigh profile so there
  are no B-Frames in the output
- Moved all references from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`; this is needed for
  WebRTC/Coturn to work properly
- Removed outdated references to `GOOS=linux` and `KILL=true`; these are the
  defaults now
