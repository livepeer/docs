title: GPU Support
---

Livepeer enables node operators to transcode video on GPUs while concurrently
mining cryptocurrencies and performing other CUDA operations such as machine
learning. As there is a very wide range of GPU hardware out there, this document
aims to crowdsource a list of specific GPU models that have been tested and
verified to work on Livepeer. If you've tested an additional model, please
submit an update to this document.

## Overview

- Livepeer supports transcoding on NVIDIA GPUs with NVENC/NVDEC. Any GPU
  [listed here](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new)
  with those chips should theoretically work. Note that different models may be
  subject to different session limits that restrict the amount of video that can
  be transcoded.
- See
  [this document which lists tested driver versions](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/doc/gpu.md)
  on the NVIDIA cards.
