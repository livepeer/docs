<Card title="A warning on the stream's page in the Livepeer Studio UI.">
  Diagnose: This is due to the low latency playback feature using WebRTC. If
  there are bframes in the stream, the default behavior is to fallback to HLS
  playback, which means a slight increase in latency. Workaround: In the
  settings of the broadcaster, turn off the use of frames. If using OBS, select
  Livepeer as the service for the video settings.

<Card title="Streams sometimes have a difficult time reconnecting to the feed and stop.">
  Diagnose: Reconnection: If a stream is down, attempt to retry for that stream
  from other nodes nearby until there is a connection(using Livepeer player)
  Workaround: Implement a retry logic or switch over to the Livepeer player with
  the SDK or iframe embedded player.

<Card title="Is there a way we could update the viewerId and video watch event to livestream / asset through Livepeer API?">
Diagnose: We do not support pagination yet but it is a pending feature. You can use the playbackId as a workaround.
Workaround: A short term workaround could be to "paginate" by playbackId instead.
- First list all playback ids with: `/api/data/views/query?breakdownBy[]=playbackId`
- then viewers by playbackId with `/api/data/views/query?playbackId=<pid>&breakdownBy[]=viewerId`

<Card title="Is there a way to update width and height of iframe embedded player">
  Diagnose: Yes, you can use the iframe embedded player and set the width and
  height in the iframe tag, however the best way to do this is to use the aspect
  ratio.

<Card title="How to enforce webrtc playback, to ensure it is always low latency otherwise fail?">
There are two solutions to accomplish this:
1. If you are using react component, you can pass `lowLatency="force"` to the player component.
You can
```js
function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="My Livestream"
      playbackId="wwl88k4g8f5eese9"
      lowLatency="force"
    />
  );
}
```

2. If you are using the iframe embedded player, you can add `lowLatency=true` to
   the query string. `lvpr.tv/?v={playbackid}&lowLatency=true`

<Card title="When creating a thumbnail from a live stream, it needs to wait for the first thumbnail to be available. this generally takes less than a min. Then before a dynamic thumbnail is accessible, what is used to show on the player?">
You can use a poster image by default for a player, then, when playback info API returns the thumbnail url, you can start to use dynamic thumbnail for preview.
Here is how to set up a poster image in Player:
You can set the poster image for a video by utilizing the poster property in Livepeer’s Player component. This property can take either an image URL or a React component as its value.
To set the poster image with a URL, you can use the following code example:

```js
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="YOUR_PLAYBACK_ID"
      poster="YOUR_IMAGE_URL"
    />
  );
}
```

If you prefer using a React component, then you can create an image component
and pass it as a value to the poster property. Here is a code example that
illustrates how you can do this:

```js
=
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";
import Image from "next/image";
import yourPosterImage from "./images/your-image-file.png";

const PosterImageComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={yourPosterImage}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

function PlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="YOUR_PLAYBACK_ID"
      poster={<PosterImageComponent />}
    />
  );
};
```
