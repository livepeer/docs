## Part 1 — Decisions Already Made

These are LOCKED. They do not need re-deciding. Any agent or session that asks for these again has not read this file.

### D-NAV-01 — Navigation Disambiguation Page (LOCKED 2026-03-23)

`pageType: navigation` disambiguation page is a locked cross-tab pattern. S1 on the Orchestrators tab ("Which path is mine?") is a single shared file — not per-persona. All setup paths reference this as their entry point. Reversal condition: holds as long as `pageType: navigation` remains a canonical page type.

### Terminology — Already Verified (LOCKED 2026-03-23)

| Term | Canonical Form | Status | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| BYOC | Bring Your Own Container | LOCKED | Human |
| NaaP | Network-as-a-Product | LOCKED (provisional — style guide pending) | Human |
| LIP-92 | Treasury Contribution Percentage | LOCKED — NOT AI capability registry | Human |

### Terminology — Open Items

| Term | Issue | Priority | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| NaaP style guide form | May be "Network as a Platform" | LOW | Human |
| Unbonding period | 21 rounds vs "21 hours" disputed | BLOCKING (Delegators, not Orchestrators) | Human/SME |
| Fee cut direction convention | v1→v2 possible percentage inversion | HIGH (Orchestrators) | SME verification |

### Tab Priority Order (LOCKED 2026-03-23)

Orchestrators (1) → Gateways (2) → Developers (3) → About (4) → Delegators (5)

### v2/ is Canonical Path

All work targets `v2/orchestrators/`. v1 is legacy reference only.

### Pipeline Scope

Gateways + Orchestrators first — only tabs structurally close to standard section vocabulary.

### Phase Ordering Correction (LOCKED)

Phase 6 (Content) → Phase 8 (Naming) → Phase 7 (Veracity) → Phase 10 (Layout). Phase 8 BEFORE Phase 7.

### Glossary Authority (LOCKED)

- `resources/glossary.mdx` = human-made, reviewed, AUTHORITATIVE
- `resources/compendium/glossary.mdx` = AI-generated, UNVERIFIED — review against human version before trusting

### 12-Section Structure (S1-S12)

| # | Section | pageType | purpose | lifecycleStage | Reader Question |
|---|---------|----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| S1 | Which path is mine? | `navigation` | `orient` | `discover` | I have GPU hardware — am I solo, AI-focused, or pool? |
| S2 | Is this viable for my hardware? | `concept` | `evaluate` | `evaluate` | Will my GPU and capital qualify for meaningful income? |
| S3 | How does work reach me / how do I get paid? | `concept` | `explain` | `evaluate` | What determines whether gateways send me jobs? |
| S4 | Prerequisites | `concept` | `learn` | `setup` | What hardware, tokens, wallet, network access do I need? |
| S5 | Get your node running | `instruction` | `start` | `setup` | How do I install, configure, register, and go live? |
| S6 | Join as a pool node | `guide` | `orient` | `evaluate` | I don't have enough stake — how does pool work? |
| S7 | Set pricing and cuts | `guide` | `configure` | `setup` | What should I charge and what cuts should I set? |
| S8 | Set up AI pipelines | `instruction` | `build` | `build` | How do I configure AI inference and advertise capabilities? |
| S9 | Verify node end to end | `instruction` | `verify` | `setup` | How do I confirm I'm discoverable and receiving work? |
| S10 | Monitor and operate | `guide` | `operate` | `operate` | What should I watch and what routine tasks must I do? |
| S11 | Optimise earnings | `guide` | `optimise` | `optimise` | I want more work or better margins — what levers? |
| S12 | Diagnose and fix | `guide` | `troubleshoot` | `troubleshoot` | My node stopped receiving work — what do I do? |

### 5 Personas

| Rank | Persona | Consensus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Independent GPU operator — choosing a path | 4/4 (PRIMARY) |
| 2 | AI inference specialist | 4/4 |
| 3 | Capital-constrained operator (pool candidate) | 4/4 |
| 4 | Running operator (return visit) | 3/4 |
| 5 | Delegator-turned-operator | 2/4 |

### 7 Jobs to be Done

| # | When... | I want to... | So I can... |
|---|---------|-------------|-------------|
| J1 | I have GPU hardware and just heard about this | assess viability and path requirements | make a go/no-go decision |
| J2 | I've decided but don't know which path | identify solo video, AI-only, dual, or pool | start the correct path |
| J3 | Ready to set up, no on-chain prereqs done | complete wallet, LPT, ETH bridging | unblock node software |
| J4 | Prerequisites done, want working node | follow complete setup sequence | reach live, discoverable, processing state |
| J5 | Running but not getting enough work | diagnose pricing, active set, perf score, capabilities | fix the correct variable |
| J6 | Want to configure AI inference | set up aiModels.json, warm models, advertise | earn from AI jobs |
| J7 | Operating and need a specific value | look up flag, threshold, cut setting | make confident config change |

### Entry Blockers

- LPT stake (solo video path — hard stop)
- ETH for gas (all on-chain paths)
- Publicly reachable service URI (all paths)
- VRAM capacity (AI path)
- Pool membership arrangement (pool path)
- Capability advertisement (AI path)

### Design Flags (Carry to Phase 3)

- S5 may need to split (solo vs pool instruction pages)
- S8 may need to split (AI config surface too large)
- S8 BYOC path not covered

### Validation Outstanding Items

- ~~LIP-92 (was BLOCKING)~~ → RESOLVED: LIP-92 = Treasury Contribution Percentage (D-TERM decisions above)
- BYOC path coverage (HIGH for S8 design)
- Active set size (NON-BLOCKING — governance-controlled, never hard-code)
- Pool node term (NON-BLOCKING — glossary needs "Pool Worker" → "Pool node" update)

## Part 5 — What Is Actually Needed to Complete Orchestrators

### Gate Status (Current → Target)

| Gate | Current | What's needed to open |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| IA Approved | ⬜ | Human reviews S1-S12 + locks |
| Terminology Locked | ⬜ | Resolve fee cut direction (HIGH), update glossary Pool Worker → Pool node |
| Content Scan Done | ⬜ | Run content-scan.md on v2/orchestrators/ |

  Agent: IA-mapped research pack (→ orchestrators-research-pack-v2.md)
  Agent: Phase 1b persona iteration check
  ↓
HUMAN: Review scan + research pack + persona flags
  ↓
Agent: Structure audit → tab-map
  ↓
HUMAN: Approve tab-map + persona journey smoke-test
  ↓
PARALLEL:
  Agent: Terminology lock (resolve fee cut, update glossary)
  Agent: Voice rules confirmation for orchestrator audience
  ↓
Agent: Content audit (AUDIT mode per section group)
  ↓
HUMAN: Approve reconsolidation plan
  ↓
Agent: Reconsolidation (file moves, docs.json, stubs)
  ↓
CONTENT WRITING (section by section, 12 sections):
  Per page: brief → HUMAN approves → WRITE → HUMAN reviews
  ↓
Agent: Naming audit (≥20/25 per heading)
  ↓
Agent: Veracity pass (REVIEW markers + veracityStatus)
  ↓
HUMAN: Clear veracity flags
  ↓
Agent: Layout pass (MDX, components, frontmatter)
  ↓
HUMAN: Approve layout
  ↓
Agent: Universal pages (glossary, portal, navigator, FAQ)

## Part 6 — Known Issues Specific to Orchestrators

1. **Fee cut direction convention** — HIGH. v1 says 95% = orchestrator keeps 95%. v2 says 5% = orchestrator keeps 5%. These may be describing the same thing differently OR there's an actual inversion. Needs SME verification against BondingManager contract. BLOCKS accurate content in S3 (payment mechanics), S7 (pricing/cuts), S12 (staking).

2. **BYOC path not covered** — S8 design flag. BYOC (Bring Your Own Container) is a distinct setup path for non-standard AI models. May warrant its own page within AI section. Human decision needed during Phase 3.

3. **S5 may need split** — Solo operator setup vs pool node setup are different enough that a single instruction page may be unworkable. Phase 3 audit will confirm.

4. **S8 may need split** — AI configuration surface (aiModels.json, warm models, capability advertisement, BYOC) may be too large for one page. Phase 3 audit will confirm.

5. **operator-rationale.mdx formatting error** — Stray characters `glrw\npwrfs` before YAML frontmatter. Fix before any content pass.

6. **Two pool guides** — `join-a-pool.mdx` (older) and `new-join-a-pool.mdx` (rewritten) both in nav. Phase 4 AUDIT must resolve (likely KEEP new, DROP old).

7. **Frontmatter validator** — `frontmatter-taxonomy.js` still uses old 12-type schema. Pages with canonical 7-type values will fail CI. Core migration is done (deprecated aliases work). New field validators (persona, industry, niche, lifecycleStage, veracityStatus) not yet added.

8. **30+ pages missing `purpose` field** — All setup, quickstart, tutorial, and newer how_to pages lack purpose in frontmatter. Will be set during Phase 6/Phase 10.

9. **Active set size** — Governance-controlled. Never hard-code. Always use `[verify-live]` annotation.

10. **Pool node term** — Glossary still says "Pool Worker" as primary. Must be updated to "Pool node" per terminology lock.
