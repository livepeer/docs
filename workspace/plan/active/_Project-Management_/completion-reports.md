## Template Cleanup + Icon Map Framework — 2026-03-21

**Plans**: `workspace/plan/active/SNIPPETS/template-audit.md`, `workspace/plan/active/SNIPPETS/template-plan.md`
**Scope**: Audited and removed the `v2/templates/` preview pipeline; fixed source-side issues in `snippets/templates/`; extended the icon map framework.

### Summary

`v2/templates/` was a folder of generated preview pages written by `generate-ui-templates.js` into the user-facing `v2/` directory — wrong location, no real consumption path beyond rendered stubs. The preview pipeline was stripped from the generator, the 21-file folder deleted, and 5 source-side issues in `snippets/templates/` resolved (naming, duplicates, wrong extension, README clarity). In the same session the icon map was extended from 30 to 78 icons and a compliance audit script was created.

---

### Completed

**Icon map framework**
- Extended `icon-map.jsx` from 30 → 78 icons across 11 sections; added `iconMapPageTypeDefaults` export (14 page-type → canonical icon mappings)
- Created `audit-icon-usage.js` — scans all MDX for `icon="..."` values, reports mapped vs unmapped against the canonical map
- Updated `icon-map.mdx` with Page-Type Canonical Defaults table and Audit Tooling section; status `draft` → `current`

**Glossary companion JSONs**
- 5 background agents added 18 terms to per-tab and consolidated glossaries
- Regenerated all 10 companion JSON files; consolidated glossary grew 426 → 440 terms

**Phase 1 — Strip preview pipeline from generator**
- Removed all preview-pipeline code from `operations/scripts/generators/components/library/generate-ui-templates.js`: constants (`BLOCK_PREVIEW_PATH`, `PREVIEW_DETAILS`, `LEGACY_PAGE_PREVIEW_ALIASES`), functions (`renderPagePreviewContent`, `renderBlockPreviewContent`, `removeStalePagePreviews`), and all preview write calls
- Catalog table updated to 4 columns (no Preview); `v2/templates` removed from all string references; resolved pre-existing merge conflict in the file

**Phase 2 — Delete `v2/templates/`**
- All 21 generated preview files deleted; `v2/index.mdx` regenerated without the Templates section

**Phase 3 — Catalog table**
- Handled within Phase 1 generator update; `docs-guide/catalog/ui-templates.mdx` regenerated clean

**Phase 4 — Source file fixes in `snippets/templates/`**
- Renamed 4 files to remove stale `-template` suffix from slugs (4-A)
- Deleted duplicate root-level `openapi-endpoint-page.mdx`; updated path reference in `contribute-to-the-docs.mdx` (4-B)
- Renamed `tutorial-template.md` → `tutorial.mdx`; added minimal valid frontmatter (file was empty) (4-C)
- Updated `README.mdx` to document `pages/` vs `docs-guide/` categories and naming convention (4-D)

**Phase 5 — Config and test cleanup**
- Removed all `v2/templates` references from: `script-registry.json`, `ownerless-governance-surfaces.json`, `run-all.js`, `v2-link-audit.test.js`, `run-pr-checks.js` (bonus — not in original plan)

---

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Drop preview pipeline entirely (Option B) — not move it to docs-guide/ | No real consumption path. Preview pages rendered raw stubs with placeholder text. The only consumer was `[view]` links in the catalog table. Not worth maintaining. |
| Keep `reference-and-api/` copy of `openapi-endpoint-page.mdx` | Better categorized; content was identical. Root-level copy was the stale one. |
| Add minimal scaffold to empty `tutorial.mdx` | Generator requires valid frontmatter to run. Content quality is deferred to CONTENT-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES plan. |
| Block-examples overview page — static authored page, not generated | The concept has value but the generated version was raw stubs. A static page with annotated examples is more useful and shouldn't be auto-generated. |

---

### Deferred Items

| Item | Priority | Reason | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static block-examples overview page | Low | Authoring task, out of scope for structural cleanup | None — can start independently |
| `tutorial.mdx` content | Low | File was empty; placeholder only | CONTENT-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES plan |
| Navigation validation error (1 error in `docs-navigation.test.js`) | Pre-existing | About `docs.json` redirect rule for Resource Hub tab — unrelated to template cleanup | Whoever owns docs.json work |

---

### Dependencies & Downstream Effects

- **VS Code snippet keys**: 4 template source files were renamed (4-A). The generator regenerated `.vscode/templates.code-snippets` with updated keys. Authors with old prefix completions cached (e.g. `template-glossary-tab-template`) will need to reload their snippet index.
- **`iconMapPageTypeDefaults` export**: Available at `snippets/data/reference-maps/icon-map.jsx` for any future script that validates icon choices by page type.
- **Glossary companion JSONs**: Must be re-run (`generate-glossary-companions.js`) whenever new glossary terms are added, to keep JSON files current for AI/crawler discoverability.
- **Generator is now the single source of truth**: `docs-guide/catalog/ui-templates.mdx` is fully generated. Do not edit it by hand — run `node operations/scripts/generators/components/library/generate-ui-templates.js --write` after any `snippets/templates/` change.

---

### Test / Validation State

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Generator `--check` | ✅ Clean | |
| Generator `--write` | ✅ Clean | `ui-templates.mdx` and `templates.code-snippets` updated |
| `docs-guide-sot.test.js` | ✅ Clean | Must be run from repo root (uses `process.cwd()`) |
| `run-all.js` | Pre-existing failures only | Navigation (1 — docs.json redirect rule), AI-tools registry (13), Skill docs (3), Root Allowlist (4), Style guide (559 errors) — none introduced by this work |

---

### Recommendations

1. **Run `generate-ui-templates.js --write` on any `snippets/templates/` change** — it's the single source of truth for the catalog and snippets files. Add this to any template-authoring workflow docs.
2. **Create the static block-examples overview page** — recommended location: `docs-guide/features/block-templates.mdx` with real annotated examples. Low effort, high authoring value.
3. **Run icon audit periodically** — `node tools/scripts/audits/content/reference/audit-icon-usage.js --md --verbose`. 287 icons currently unmapped; prioritize any with 10+ occurrences.
4. **Extend `audit-icon-usage.js` to validate page-type defaults** — flag cards/accordions linking to a known page type that use a non-canonical icon. `iconMapPageTypeDefaults` is already available for this.
5. **Resolve the pre-existing navigation validation error** — `docs.json` Resource Hub tab requires `v2/resources/redirect` as first page. Unrelated to this work but should be addressed before the next deploy.
