## Claims Reviewed

- `v2/orchestrators/concepts/architecture.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Layer Participants Responsibility Application Developers, streaming platforms, AI products Send requests to Gateways; receive results Gateway Gateway operators Aggregate demand, select Orchestrators, dispatch jobs, handle payments Compute (Orchestrator) Orchestrators, transcoders, AI runners Execute video and AI work on GPUs; manage workers; receive payment tickets Protocol Arbitrum smart contracts Staking, reward distribution, payment settlement, orchestrator registry Orchestrators are the only participants that interact with all layers below the Gateway accepting jobs from the Gateway layer, executing them at the compute layer, and transacting with the protocol layer for staking, rewards, and payment ticket redemption.
  - extracted: Arbitrum Protocol Orchestrators interact with four Arbitrum smart contracts: Contract Orchestrator interaction BondingManager Stake LPT (self bond), receive delegated stake, set reward cut and fee cut, call rewards each round RoundsManager Track active rounds; the reward call is triggered once per round per Orchestrator TicketBroker Redeem winning probabilistic micropayment tickets for ETH; receive service fees from Gateways ServiceRegistry Register service URI so Gateways can discover the Orchestrator on chain The AIServiceRegistry contract ( on Arbitrum Mainnet) is separate from the primary ServiceRegistry and is used specifically for AI subnet registration.
  - extracted: The contract is currently detached from the main protocol controller confirm the current integration status with your setup guide.
  - extracted: Dual Pipeline Architecture The Orchestrator node ( in go livepeer) runs two independent processing pipelines one for video transcoding and one for AI inference.
- `v2/orchestrators/concepts/capabilities.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Every capability an Orchestrator exposes must be declared on registration so Gateways can discover and select it.
  - extracted: Which workloads a node accepts depends on its hardware, the pipelines and models it has loaded, and how it is configured.
  - extracted: Workload What the Orchestrator does Unit of work GPU required Video transcoding Re encode live video segments from RTMP ingest into multiple output profiles (resolution, bitrate, format) Per segment (typically 2 seconds of video) Yes (NVENC preferred; CPU possible) Batch AI inference Run single request AI jobs: text to image, image to image, image to video, audio to text, upscale, segmentation Per request (pixel or millisecond based) Yes (VRAM requirements vary by model) Real time AI (Cascade) Apply continuous AI processing to a live video stream style transfer, avatar rendering, real time generative overlays Per interval during stream duration Yes (high VRAM; dedicated GPU strongly recommended) BYOC containers Execute application defined Docker containers on Orchestrator hardware for custom ML workflows or novel compute tasks Per request or per interval (defined by pipeline) Depends on container An Orchestrator running both video transcoding and AI inference is described as operating in a dual workload configuration.
  - extracted: This is not a separate mode it is the same Orchestrator process with both pipelines enabled.
- `v2/orchestrators/concepts/incentive-model.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Orchestrators earn from two independent sources: ETH service fees for processing jobs, and LPT inflation rewards for protocol participation.
  - extracted: Both require active set membership.
  - extracted: Earnings from fees depend on workload volume; earnings from rewards depend on total stake and the reward cut configuration.
  - extracted: Stream Currency Source Frequency Depends on Service fees ETH Gateways paying for compute (transcoding or AI inference) Per job (ticket redemption is probabilistic) Volume of work received; price configuration; uptime Inflation rewards LPT Protocol inflation (new LPT minted per round) Once per round (~22 hours) via reward call Total bonded stake (self stake + delegated); reward cut setting Service Fees (ETH) Service fees are paid by Gateways via probabilistic micropayment (PM) tickets.
- `v2/orchestrators/concepts/role.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Instead of AWS allocating compute capacity, Livepeer Gateways select your node based on price, capability, and stake weight.
  - extracted: Running an Orchestrator is closer to being a validator on a proof of stake chain than to running a simple Ethereum node but the work is compute rather than consensus.
  - extracted: You stake LPT to signal commitment and earn the right to enter the active set (the top 100 eligible Orchestrators by total stake).
  - extracted: From there, you earn ETH service fees for every job you process, plus LPT inflation rewards for calling rewards each round.

## Verified Claims

- `orch-price-ceiling-filtering` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Gateways filter orchestrators by price ceilings before routing work. Competitive hardware alone is not enough if operator pricing exceeds gateway maxima.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/monitoring-and-tooling/troubleshooting.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms

## Conflicted Claims

- `orch-batch-ai-vram-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Docs disagree on the practical VRAM minimum for batch AI and real-time AI workloads. Hardware and setup pages should not present conflicting minimums as equally current.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/rcs-requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 11 matched terms; current-language match 15; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-pool-vs-solo-prerequisites` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Pool workers and solo operators have different prerequisites. Pages should not imply that LPT, ETH, or public service exposure are universal requirements for every orchestrator entry path.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/join-a-pool.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-active-set-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Solo transcoding guidance repeatedly states that operators need enough bonded LPT to enter the active set, often phrased as top 100, but that wording is time-sensitive and should not be treated as durable fact without current evidence.
  - primary evidence: official-page → https://explorer.livepeer.org/orchestrators
  - evidence why: source priority 100
- `orch-ai-routing-capability-based` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx`
  - summary: AI jobs are routed primarily by capability match and price ceilings rather than by stake weight. Docs should not collapse AI routing into the same rules as transcoding routing.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-siphon-reward-isolation` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx`
  - summary: A split setup with OrchestratorSiphon isolates the keystore from the GPU machine and keeps reward calling independent of GPU uptime. Docs should keep that claim aligned across setup-path pages.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 11 matched terms
- `orch-dual-revenue-model` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Operator economics pages should keep the two revenue streams aligned: ETH service fees scale with workload and gateway demand, while LPT inflation rewards scale with stake and reward-call reliability. Docs should not flatten those into one generic earnings model.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-siphon-github-current` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Split-setup guidance depends on OrchestratorSiphon still being an active community-maintained project. That claim should be checked against the current GitHub repository, not just repeated in docs.
  - primary evidence: github-repo → https://github.com/Stronk-Tech/OrchestratorSiphon
  - evidence why: source priority 60; 4 matched terms; recency 56d; state active

## Time-Sensitive Claims

- `orch-bandwidth-per-stream-planning` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Bandwidth planning for transcoding is currently presented as an approximate planning rule rather than a single durable network constant. Pages should make the source-resolution assumption and rendition-set basis explicit when quoting per-stream bandwidth.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 2 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-consumer-nvenc-session-cap` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Consumer NVIDIA NVENC session-cap guidance is factual but volatile. Hardware requirement and transcoding guides should stay aligned on whether GeForce-class cards are typically capped at 2-3 concurrent sessions and whether newer generations changed that default.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-session-limit-default` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: The default session limit and overload behavior are operational facts that multiple setup and hardware pages depend on. When docs state the default cap or the error condition, they should stay aligned with current go-livepeer behavior.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 7 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-reward-profitability-threshold` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx`
  - summary: Reward-call profitability guidance should remain explicitly time-sensitive because gas cost, ETH price, and LPT price move. Docs must not present rough thresholds as durable constants.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
