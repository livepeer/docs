## Claims Reviewed

- `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx`
  - claim families: `orch-active-set-threshold`, `orch-bandwidth-per-stream-planning`, `orch-batch-ai-vram-threshold`, `orch-business-case-cost-viability`, `orch-commercial-model-warmth`, `orch-dual-revenue-model`, `orch-pool-vs-solo-prerequisites`, `orch-reward-profitability-threshold`
  - extracted: It explains how fee driven operation differs from inflation first participation, what Gateways actually care about, and what has to change when the goal is recurring service revenue rather than opportunistic earnings.
  - extracted: Hobbyist vs Commercial The Livepeer Orchestrator ecosystem supports both models, but they reward different behaviour.
  - extracted: One is optimised for lower risk participation and base rewards.
  - extracted: Dimension Hobbyist operator Commercial operator Primary income LPT inflation rewards ETH service fees from job processing Revenue lever Total bonded stake Job volume, pricing discipline, uptime Uptime requirement ~95% (reward calls + basic availability) 99%+ (SLA driven, continuous monitoring) Gateway relationship Passive wait to be selected by price and stake Active direct relationships, per Gateway pricing Hardware approach Existing hardware repurposed Dedicated investment, redundancy planned Monitoring Periodic checks, Prometheus optional Automated alerting, SLA dashboards Model loading Load on demand; cold starts acceptable Pre loaded and warm; cold starts are SLA failures Neither model is inherently better.
- `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-impact.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: Orchestrators hold governance weight proportional to their total bonded stake.
  - extracted: Every LPT staked to an Orchestrator whether self staked or delegated becomes voting influence over the protocol that shapes operator economics, network priorities, and the infrastructure Livepeer can support.
  - extracted: How Votes Work Livepeer governance uses a stake weighted voting system built around Livepeer Improvement Proposals (LIPs).
  - extracted: Key mechanics: Voting weight equals total bonded stake (Orchestrator self stake plus all delegated LPT) Passing threshold requires 33.33% of all staked LPT to support AND 50% of votes cast to approve Delegator override Delegators can vote independently, overriding their Orchestrator's position on a specific LIP Poll creation cost 100 LPT to create an on chain poll, preventing low effort or spam proposals This design gives Orchestrators with large bonded stake substantial influence, while preserving Delegator autonomy.
- `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - claim families: `orch-active-set-threshold`, `orch-bandwidth-per-stream-planning`, `orch-batch-ai-vram-threshold`, `orch-business-case-cost-viability`, `orch-dual-revenue-model`, `orch-pool-vs-solo-prerequisites`, `orch-reward-profitability-threshold`
  - extracted: Running a Livepeer Orchestrator is only worth it when your hardware, stake access, and operating tolerance line up with a realistic way to earn.
  - extracted: To skip evaluation and proceed directly to setup, see the Quick path summary Start with the row that matches your current hardware, stake access, and operating tolerance.
  - extracted: Path Best fit today Main constraint Pool worker Any NVIDIA GPU, little or no LPT, lower operating commitment Lower control and lower earnings ceiling than running a full Orchestrator Solo AI Orchestrator 24 GB+ VRAM, limited LPT, willing to manage warm models and demand shifts AI demand, model selection, and pricing change faster than video workloads Solo video Orchestrator Reliable GPU and bandwidth, plus enough LPT to stay competitive for the active set Active set stake is the biggest barrier to receiving steady video work Commercial or pool operator Multiple GPUs or direct Gateway demand, and readiness for 99%+ operational standards Requires relationship building, monitoring, and disciplined pricing What Orchestrators Earn Orchestrators earn from two separate streams.
  - extracted: You need to understand both before you can judge whether the path fits your hardware, stake, and time commitment.
- `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/requirements.mdx`
  - claim families: none
  - extracted: It is the supported line.
  - extracted: AMD and Intel GPUs are not supported for hardware accelerated transcoding or AI inference, and NVIDIA CUDA is required for both NVENC video transcoding and AI pipelines.
  - extracted: Minimum CUDA version: 12.0.
  - extracted: Earlier versions are not supported by the AI runner containers.

## Verified Claims

- `orch-price-ceiling-filtering` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Gateways filter orchestrators by price ceilings before routing work. Competitive hardware alone is not enough if operator pricing exceeds gateway maxima.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/monitoring-and-tooling/troubleshooting.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms
- `orch-pool-worker-offchain-payouts` (verified, high)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Pool-worker guidance should stay explicit that a worker is not running an orchestrator identity, does not perform on-chain operations, and receives off-chain payouts from the pool operator rather than protocol-level reward flows.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/join-a-pool.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms

## Conflicted Claims

- `orch-batch-ai-vram-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Docs disagree on the practical VRAM minimum for batch AI and real-time AI workloads. Hardware and setup pages should not present conflicting minimums as equally current.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/rcs-requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 11 matched terms; current-language match 15; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-dual-revenue-model` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Operator economics pages should keep the two revenue streams aligned: ETH service fees scale with workload and gateway demand, while LPT inflation rewards scale with stake and reward-call reliability. Docs should not flatten those into one generic earnings model.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-pool-vs-solo-prerequisites` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Pool workers and solo operators have different prerequisites. Pages should not imply that LPT, ETH, or public service exposure are universal requirements for every orchestrator entry path.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/join-a-pool.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-active-set-threshold` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Solo transcoding guidance repeatedly states that operators need enough bonded LPT to enter the active set, often phrased as top 100, but that wording is time-sensitive and should not be treated as durable fact without current evidence.
  - primary evidence: official-page → https://explorer.livepeer.org/orchestrators
  - evidence why: source priority 100
- `orch-siphon-reward-isolation` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx`
  - summary: A split setup with OrchestratorSiphon isolates the keystore from the GPU machine and keeps reward calling independent of GPU uptime. Docs should keep that claim aligned across setup-path pages.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/siphon-setup.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 11 matched terms
- `orch-ai-routing-capability-based` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx`
  - summary: AI jobs are routed primarily by capability match and price ceilings rather than by stake weight. Docs should not collapse AI routing into the same rules as transcoding routing.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/ai-and-job-workloads/job-types.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-siphon-github-current` (conflicted, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/setup-options.mdx`
  - summary: Split-setup guidance depends on OrchestratorSiphon still being an active community-maintained project. That claim should be checked against the current GitHub repository, not just repeated in docs.
  - primary evidence: github-repo → https://github.com/Stronk-Tech/OrchestratorSiphon
  - evidence why: source priority 60; 4 matched terms; recency 56d; state active

## Time-Sensitive Claims

- `orch-reward-profitability-threshold` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx`
  - summary: Reward-call profitability guidance should remain explicitly time-sensitive because gas cost, ETH price, and LPT price move. Docs must not present rough thresholds as durable constants.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/staking-and-rewards/rewards-and-fees.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-bandwidth-per-stream-planning` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: Bandwidth planning for transcoding is currently presented as an approximate planning rule rather than a single durable network constant. Pages should make the source-resolution assumption and rendition-set basis explicit when quoting per-stream bandwidth.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 2 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
- `orch-business-case-cost-viability` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx`
  - summary: Business-case guidance should explicitly stay approximate and local-context dependent. Payback, electricity cost, and 'worth it' framing are useful, but they should not be presented as portable constants across operators, geographies, or market conditions.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/operator-rationale.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 10 matched terms; current-language match 46; historical-language penalty 2
- `orch-commercial-model-warmth` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx`
  - summary: Commercial AI operator guidance should keep warm-model, pre-loaded startup, and cold-start SLA language aligned across setup and business-case pages. These claims describe real operational expectations, but they remain experimental and workload-sensitive.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 9 matched terms
- `orch-consumer-nvenc-session-cap` (time-sensitive, low)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx`
  - summary: Consumer NVIDIA NVENC session-cap guidance is factual but volatile. Hardware requirement and transcoding guides should stay aligned on whether GeForce-class cards are typically capped at 2-3 concurrent sessions and whether newer generations changed that default.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/guides/deployment-details/requirements.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; repo file missing
- `orch-session-limit-default` (time-sensitive, medium)
  - owner: `v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx`
  - summary: The default session limit and overload behavior are operational facts that multiple setup and hardware pages depend on. When docs state the default cap or the error condition, they should stay aligned with current go-livepeer behavior.
  - primary evidence: repo-file → v2/orchestrators/setup/configure.mdx
  - evidence why: source priority 90; 7 matched terms; current-language match 7; historical-language penalty 1
