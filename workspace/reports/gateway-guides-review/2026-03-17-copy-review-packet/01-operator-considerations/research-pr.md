## Claim Families

- `gw-offchain-payment-obligation` (off-chain-payment-obligation) — verified, high confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/payments-and-pricing/payment-guide.mdx`
- `gw-price-cap-role` (price-cap-role) — verified, high confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/payments-and-pricing/pricing-strategy.mdx`
- `gw-spe-funded-provider-examples` (ecosystem-provider-examples) — conflicted, low confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/operator-considerations/production-gateways.mdx`
- `gw-self-hosted-business-case` (business-case-viability) — conflicted, low confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/operator-considerations/business-case.mdx`
- `gw-clearinghouse-public-readiness` (clearinghouse-public-readiness) — conflicted, low confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/payments-and-pricing/clearinghouse-guide.mdx`
- `gw-remote-signer-current-scope` (remote-signer-current-scope) — conflicted, low confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/payments-and-pricing/remote-signers.mdx`
- `gw-community-signer-testing-surface` (community-signer-testing-surface) — time-sensitive, medium confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/payments-and-pricing/payment-guide.mdx`
- `gw-startup-program-current` (programme-availability) — time-sensitive, medium confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/roadmap-and-funding/operator-support.mdx`
- `gw-discord-community-signal` (discord-intake-repo-signal) — unverified, medium confidence, owner: `v2/gateways/guides/operator-considerations/production-gateways.mdx`

## Unresolved Items

- `gw-spe-funded-provider-examples` (conflicted) — Gateway comparison and support pages should only present provider examples that are still backed by current SPE/governance or public project evidence.
- `gw-self-hosted-business-case` (conflicted) — Gateway business-case pages should keep self-hosting viability contextual: control, cost savings, support burden, and payment complexity depend on workload volume and operational mode, not on one universal recommendation.
- `gw-clearinghouse-public-readiness` (conflicted) — Gateway payment docs should describe clearinghouse status with current precision: the protocol is implemented, but no public clearinghouse is generally available yet. Community-hosted signer access is a testing bridge, not evidence of GA.
- `gw-remote-signer-current-scope` (conflicted) — Remote-signer docs should keep the current support boundary explicit: remote signing is a current payment path for Live AI / real-time AI workloads, and it is not supported for video transcoding.
- `gw-community-signer-testing-surface` (time-sensitive) — Docs that mention the Elite Encoder community signer should keep its role narrow and explicit: a repo/community-backed testing surface for early off-chain experimentation, not a generic production recommendation.
- `gw-startup-program-current` (time-sensitive) — Gateway support content should only describe the AI Video Startup Program with the level of certainty supported by current official and forum evidence.
- `gw-discord-community-signal` (unverified) — Repo-available Discord intake workflow artifacts are a weak supplementary signal for technical gateway issue intake only. They should never stand in for programme status, support availability, or general support-channel claims.
