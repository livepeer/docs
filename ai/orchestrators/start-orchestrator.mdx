title: Start your AI Orchestrator
---

<Warning>
  The AI Subnet is currently in **Alpha** and under active development. Running
  it on the same machine as your main Orchestrator/Gateway node may lead to
  stability issues. Please proceed with caution.
</Warning>

The AI Subnet is not yet integrated into the main
[go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer) software due to its
**Alpha** status. To equip your Orchestrator node with AI inference
capabilities, please use the `ai-video` branch of
[go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/ai-video). This
branch contains the necessary software for the AI Orchestrator. Currently, there
are two methods to run the AI Subnet software:

- **Docker**: This is the most straightforward and recommended method to run the
  AI Orchestrator node.
- **Pre-built Binaries**: Pre-built binaries are available if you prefer not to
  use Docker.

## Start the AI Orchestrator

Please follow the steps below to start your AI Subnet Orchestrator node:

    <Tab title="Use Docker (Recommended)">
        <Steps>
            <Step title="Retrieve the AI Subnet Docker Image">
                Fetch the latest AI Subnet Docker image from the [Livepeer Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/go-livepeer) with the following command:

                ```bash
                docker pull livepeer/go-livepeer:ai-video
                ```
            </Step>
            <Step title="Fetch the Latest AI Runner Docker Image">
                The Livepeer AI Subnet employs a [containerized workflow](https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization) for running AI models. Fetch the latest [AI Runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/ai-runner) image with this command:

                ```bash
                docker pull livepeer/ai-runner:latest
                ```
            </Step>
            <Step title="Verify the AI Models are Available">
                The AI Subnet leverages pre-trained AI models for inference tasks. Before launching the AI Orchestrator node, verify that the weights of these models are accessible on your machine. For more information, visit the [Download AI Models](/ai/orchestrators/models-download) page.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Configure your AI Orchestrator">
                Confirm that the AI models are correctly set up in the `aiModels.json` file in the `~/.lpData/` directory. For guidance on configuring the `aiModels.json` file, refer to the [AI Models Configuration](/ai/orchestrators/models-config) page. The configuration file should resemble:

                ```json
                [
                    {
                        "pipeline": "text-to-image",
                        "model_id": "ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning",
                        "price_per_unit": 4768371,
                        "warm": true,
                    }
                ]
                ```
            </Step>
            <Step title="Launch an (Offchain) AI Orchestrator">
                Execute the AI Subnet Docker image using the following command:

                ```bash
                docker run \
                    --name livepeer_ai_orchestrator \
                    -v ~/.lpData/:/root/.lpData/ \
                    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                    --network host \
                    --gpus all \
                    livepeer/go-livepeer:ai-video \
                    -orchestrator \
                    -transcoder \
                    -serviceAddr 0.0.0.0:8936 \
                    -v 6 \
                    -nvidia "all" \
                    -aiWorker \
                    -aiModels /root/.lpData/aiModels.json \
                    -aiModelsDir ~/.lpData/models
                ```

                This command launches an **offchain** AI Orchestrator node. While most of the commands are akin to those used when operating a Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator node (explained in the [go-livepeer CLI reference](/references/go-livepeer/cli-reference)), there are a few AI Subnet specific flags:

                - `-aiWorker`: This flag enables the AI Worker functionality.
                - `-aiModels`: This flag sets the path to the JSON file that contains the AI models.
                - `-aiModelsDir`: This flag indicates the directory where the AI models are stored on the host machine.

                Moreover, the `--network host` flag facilitates communication between the AI Orchestrator and the AI Runner container.

                <Warning>Please note that since we use [docker-out-of-docker](https://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2017/04/23/docker-out-of-docker/), the `aiModelsDir` path should be defined as being on the host machine.</Warning>
            </Step>
            <Step title="Confirm the AI Orchestrator is Operational">
                If your AI Subnet Orchestrator node is functioning correctly, you should see the following output:

                ```bash

            </Step>
            <Step title="Check Port Availability">
                To make your AI Subnet Orchestrator node accessible from the internet, you need to configure your network settings. Ensure that port `8936` is unblocked on your machine. Additionally, consider setting up port forwarding on your router, allowing the Gateway node to be reachable from the internet.

            {/* TODO: Simplify this step */}
            <Step title="Download the Latest AI Subnet Binary">
                Download the latest AI subnet binary for your system:

                ```bash
                wget https://build.livepeer.live/go-livepeer/ai-video/latest/livepeer-<OS>-gpu-<ARCH>.tar.gz
                ```

                Replace `<OS>` and `<ARCH>` with your system's operating system and architecture. For example, for a Linux system with an AMD64 architecture, the command would be:

                ```bash
                wget https://build.livepeer.live/go-livepeer/ai-video/latest/livepeer-linux-gpu-amd64.tar.gz
                ```

                See the [go-livepeer installation guide](/orchestrators/guides/install-go-livepeer#install-using-a-binary-release) for more information on the available binaries.

## Confirm the AI Orchestrator is Operational

Once the AI Subnet Orchestrator node is up and running, validate its operation
by sending an AI inference request directly to the
[ai-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/ai-runner) container. The most
straightforward way to do this is through the
[swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/) interface, accessible at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`.

![Swagger UI interface](/images/ai/swagger_ui.png)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access the Swagger UI">
        Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your web browser to open the Swagger UI interface.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initiate an Inference Request">
        Initiate an inference request to the `POST /text-to-image` endpoint by clicking the `Try it out` button. Use the following example JSON payload:

        ```json
        {
            "prompt": "A cool cat on the beach."
        }
        ```

        This request will instruct the AI model to generate an image based on the text in the `prompt` field.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inspect the Inference Response">
        If the AI Orchestrator node is functioning correctly, you should receive a response similar to the following:

        ```json
        {
            "images": [
                {
                    "url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAA...",
                    "seed": 2724904334
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        The `url` field contains the base64 encoded image generated by the AI model. To convert this image to a png, use a base64 decoder such as [Base64.guru](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image/png).
    </Step>

</Steps>
