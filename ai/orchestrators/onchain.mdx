title: On-chain Setup
---

The previous section covered the **off-chain** configuration of the AI
Orchestrator node. This section details how to connect an AI Orchestrator node
to the AI Subnet and earn fees for processing AI inference jobs.

## Prerequisites

- An established [Mainnet Orchestrator](/orchestrators/guides/get-started)
  within the Top 100 on the Livepeer network
- A dedicated static IP address or domain name for your AI Orchestrator node
- An additional Ethereum wallet, funded with enough gas to cover transaction
  fees for ticket redemption

## Ensure you can Redeem Tickets

As the AI Subnet is in its Alpha phase,
[its software](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/ai-video) isn't
integrated with the Mainnet Transcoding Network
[software stack](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer) yet. This means that
your **Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator** is currently unable to
directly redeem AI-related tickets. However, there are two methods to enable
your AI Orchestrator node to redeem tickets:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Set Ticket Recipient (recommended)">
    To enable ticket redemption for your **AI Orchestrator**, set the ticket recipient to your **Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator**'s ETH address. This method allows the earned fees to be credited directly to your main Orchestrator without requiring additional setup or causing disruption.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Wallet Creation">
        <Info>For security, it's advised to use a separate account from your Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator.</Info>

        Create a new Ethereum wallet for your **AI Orchestrator**. Follow the [Create a Wallet](/catalyst/deploying-catalyst#creating-a-wallet) guide in the [Catalyst](/catalyst/deploying-catalyst) documentation for detailed instructions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wallet Funding">
        Transfer sufficient ETH to the new wallet to cover the gas costs for redeeming AI tickets on-chain.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Recipient Configuration">
        To direct the fees earned by your AI Orchestrator to your main Orchestrator, set the ticket recipient as the Ethereum address of your main Orchestrator. This can be done by adding the following flag when launching your AI Orchestrator node:

        ```bash
        ./livepeer \
          -ethOrchAddr <MAIN_ORCH_ADDRESS> \
          ... \
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Redemption Service">
    <Warning>While this method is possible, it's not recommended because it can disrupt performance and add complexity to your _Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator_. Only proceed with this method if you are unable to create a separate wallet for your _AI Orchestrator_, and you understand the potential implications.</Warning>

    If creating a separate wallet for your _AI Orchestrator_ isn't an option, you might want to use a [redemption service](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/doc/redeemer.md). This service allows your _Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator_ to redeem tickets for your AI Orchestrator. For more details, check out the [redemption service documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/doc/redeemer.md) and the [go-livepeer CLI documentation](/references/go-livepeer/cli-reference#onchain).

## Advertising Your AI Service URI

To make your AI Orchestrator node discoverable by AI Gateway nodes on the AI
Subnet, you need to advertise your **AI service URI** on-chain. You can do this
by registering your service URI with the
[AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5)
contract on the [Arbitrum Mainnet](https://arbitrum.io).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Foundry Cast">
    The easiest and recommended method is to use the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) smart contract deployment toolchain.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Foundry Cast">
        Install [Foundry Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) by executing the following commands in your terminal:

          ```bash
          curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
          source /home/<USERNAME>/.bashrc
          foundryup
          ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set your Service URI">
        <Tip>No need to move your **Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator** wallet. You can run Foundry Cast and register your AI Orchestrator from any machine.</Tip>

        Set your Service URI, ensuring it starts with `https://`, with the `SetServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract. Use the KeyStore file and password from your **Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator** wallet:

        ```bash
        cast send --keystore '<PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE>' --password '<PASSWORD>' --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "setServiceURI(string)" https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
        ```

        After successful execution, the output should look like this:

        ```bash
        blockHash:               0x214a65d2dffd1732e971bd3662dcb681663c2eb0c95a33c8918bab0a44e2d3ed
        blockNumber:             200370198
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify your Service URI">
        Verify your Service URI by invoking the `getServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d31637eb0f442376053d5dea2347f663c4019dc) contract:

        ```bash
        cast call --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "getServiceURI(address)" <PUBLIC_WALLET_KEY> | xxd -r -p
        ```

        If successful, the output should be:

        ```bash
        https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

## Launch your On-chain AI Orchestrator

Once you've set your **AI service URI** on-chain, you can launch your **AI
Orchestrator** node to start processing AI inference jobs on the AI Subnet. The
commands to start the **AI Orchestrator** are similar to those for the
[off-chain Orchestrator](/ai/orchestrators/start-orchestrator), but with
additional flags to enable on-chain functionality:

- `-network=arbitrum-one-mainnet`: Connects the AI Orchestrator node to the
  Arbitrum Mainnet network.
- `-ethUrl=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`: Sets the Arbitrum Mainnet RPC URL. You
  can replace this with your own RPC URL.
- `-ethKeystorePath=/root/.lpData/arbitrum-one-mainnet/keystore`: Sets the path
  to the AI Orchestrator's Ethereum keystore file.
- `-ethAcctAddr <AI_SUBNET_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: Sets the Ethereum address of the
  AI Orchestrator.
- `-ethPassword=/root/.lpData/.eth_secret`: Sets the Ethereum keystore password
  file path.
- `-ethOrchAddr=<MAIN_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: Sets the Ethereum address of the
  Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator.

Due to current limitations in the AI Subnet software, two additional flags are
required:

- `-ticketEV=2999999999999`: This flag ensures that the AI Orchestrator doesn't
  trigger maximum ticket limits set by the `go-livepeer` software.
