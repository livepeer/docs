title: Download AI Models
---

AI Orchestrators on the Livepeer AI network can choose from various AI models to
advertise on the network. A comprehensive list of currently supported models for
each Livepeer AI pipeline is available on the [Pipelines](/ai/pipelines) page.
Before specifying which models to advertise on the Livepeer AI network, you must
first download the models to your machine. The following steps will guide you
through downloading the **recommended** models for Livepeer AI.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install HuggingFace CLI">
        Use the following command to install the HuggingFace CLI:

        ```bash
        pip install huggingface_hub[cli,hf_transfer]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate Hugging Face Token">
        Follow the instructions on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to generate an access token with **read** permissions. Then, use the Hugging Face CLI to install the token:

        ```bash
        huggingface-cli login
        ```
        You will be prompted to paste the access token you created on the Hugging Face website.

        <Note>If you have trouble locating `huggingface-cli` in your path, it may be necessary to add `/home/$USER/.local/bin/` to your local path.</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Accept SVD1.1 Terms">
        The currently recommended models include one **gated** model. Therefore, you must accept the terms of the [SVD1.1 model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1) on its model page before downloading.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Download AI Models">
        Use the following command to download the **recommended** models for Livepeer AI:

        ```bash
        cd ~/.lpData
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livepeer/ai-worker/main/runner/dl_checkpoints.sh | bash -s -- --beta
        ```

        This command downloads the recommended models for Livepeer AI and stores them in your machine's `~/.lpData/models` directory. To obtain a complete set of models, omit the `--beta` flag. This will require additional disk space.
    </Step>
