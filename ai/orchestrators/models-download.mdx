title: Download AI Models
---

_AI Orchestrators_ on the _AI Subnet_ can choose from a variety of AI models to
advertise on the network. A comprehensive list of currently supported models for
each AI Subnet pipeline is available on the
[Pipelines](/ai/pipelines/text-to-image) page. Before you can specify which
models to advertise on the AI Subnet, you must first download the models to your
machine. The following steps will guide you through the process of downloading
the currently **recommended** models for the AI Subnet.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install HuggingFace CLI">
        Use the following command to install the HuggingFace CLI:

        ```bash
        pip install huggingface_hub[cli,hf_transfer]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate Hugging Face Token">
        Follow the instructions on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to generate an access token. Then, use the Hugging Face CLI to install the token:

        ```bash
        huggingface-cli login
        ```

        You will be prompted to paste the access token you created on the Hugging Face website.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Accept SVD1.1 Terms">
        The currently recommended models include one **gated** model. Therefore, you must accept the terms of the [SVD1.1 model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1) on its model page prior to downloading.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Download AI Models">
        Use the following command to download the **recommended** models for the AI Subnet:

        ```bash
        cd ~/.lpData
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livepeer/ai-worker/main/scripts/download_models.sh | bash -s -- --alpha
        ```

        This command downloads the recommended models for the AI Subnet, storing them in the `~/.lpData/models` directory on your machine. For a complete set of AI Subnet models, omit the `--alpha` flag. Be aware that this requires additional disk space.
    </Step>
