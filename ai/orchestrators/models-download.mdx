title: Download AI Models
---

AI Orchestrators on the AI Subnet can choose from various AI models to advertise
on the network. A comprehensive list of currently supported models for each AI
Subnet pipeline is available on the [Pipelines](/ai/pipelines) page. Before
specifying which models to advertise on the AI Subnet, you must first download
the models to your machine. The following steps will guide you through
downloading the currently **recommended** models for the AI Subnet.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install HuggingFace CLI">
        Use the following command to install the HuggingFace CLI:

        ```bash
        pip install huggingface_hub[cli,hf_transfer]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate Hugging Face Token">
        Follow the instructions on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to generate an access token. Then, use the Hugging Face CLI to install the token:

        ```bash
        huggingface-cli login
        ```

        You will be prompted to paste the access token you created on the Hugging Face website.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Accept SVD1.1 Terms">
        The currently recommended models include one **gated** model. Therefore, you must accept the terms of the [SVD1.1 model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1) on its model page before downloading.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Download AI Models">
        Use the following command to download the **recommended** models for the AI Subnet:

        ```bash
        cd ~/.lpData
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livepeer/ai-worker/main/runner/dl_checkpoints.sh | bash -s -- --alpha
        ```

        This command downloads the recommended models for the AI Subnet and stores them in your machine's `~/.lpData/models` directory. To obtain a complete set of AI Subnet models, omit the `--alpha` flag. This requires additional disk space.
    </Step>
