The following AI Metrics are applicable to the Livepeer Orchestrator:

`ai_models_requested`: Tracks the number of requests per capability and model.
`ai_request_latency_score`: Measures latency scores per model request per orchestrator.
`ai_request_price`: Records the price paid per unit for each model request.
`ai_request_errors`: Logs AI request errors per orchestrator. If no orchestrator is specified, this indicates a general request scenario where no orchestrators were found.
