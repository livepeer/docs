If you're interested in joining Livepeer AI as an **Orchestrator** to perform
**AI inference** on the Livepeer AI Network and earn fees, this guide is for
you. It is tailored to help you set up an AI Orchestrator node, building
upon the [Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) for the
Mainnet Transcoding Network, but with additional steps for AI operations.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, refer to the **subpages** of this guide. For a
more general understanding of Orchestrator operations, you can consult the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) for the Mainnet
Transcoding Network, as the AI guide extends upon the foundational knowledge
provided there.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your AI Orchestrator node, ensure you meet the following
requirements:

- You are operating a Top 100
  [Mainnet Orchestrator](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) on the Mainnet
  Transcoding Network
- **High VRAM GPUs Required**: Livepeer AI requires GPUs with at least 16GB of VRAM for most tasks. For optimal performance and higher job selection chances, 30/40 series GPUs or comparable models are recommended. Exact requirements are in the [AI Pipelines](/ai/pipelines) documentation.
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)** is installed on your
  machine
- **[CUDA 12.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive)** is
  installed on your machine
- **[Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)**
  is installed on your machine
- You are using a **[Linux](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)** system
  (Support for Windows and macOS is coming soon)
- You have
  **[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)** or
  higher installed (for downloading and managing AI models)
