If you're exploring the possibility of joining the AI Video Subnet as an
_Orchestrator_ to perform **AI inference** on the Livepeer network and earn
fees; this guide is for you. It's tailored to help you navigate the setup
process of an AI Orchestrator, mirroring the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) for the _Mainnet
Transcoding Network_, but with adjustments for AI operations. Dive into the
subpages for a step-by-step walkthrough. For a deeper understanding of
orchestrator operations, the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) is your go-to
resource.
