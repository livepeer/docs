If you're exploring the possibility of joining the AI Subnet as an Orchestrator
to perform **AI inference** on the Livepeer network and earn fees, this guide is
for you. It's tailored to help you navigate the setup process of an AI
Orchestrator node, mirroring the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) for the Mainnet
Transcoding Network, but with adjustments for AI operations. Dive into the
subpages for a step-by-step walkthrough. For a deeper understanding of
Orchestrator operations, the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) is your go-to
resource.
