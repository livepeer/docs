## Background on the AI Subnet

The AI Subnet, initially proposed in
[this SPE treasury proposal](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/82843445347363563575858115586375001878287509193479217286690041153234635982713),
represents a significant evolution within the Livepeer ecosystem. This
**decentralized**, **open-source** framework seamlessly integrates a variety of
**generative image and video AI inference** tasks into the existing Livepeer network infrastructure. These enhancements 
strengthen Livepeer's transcoding services, celebrated for their
**low cost** and **high reliability**, while also paving the way for groundbreaking
applications across both emerging Web3 environments and established Web2
sectors.

Designed to revolutionize creative processes, the AI Subnet reflects Livepeer's
commitment to creating a **globally accessible open video infrastructure**. Livepeer's
AI subnet aims to empower users to leverage any form of
image and video computing with AI. By equipping video applications with advanced AI
tools and reducing reliance on centralized computing resources, we are dedicated to extending 
**cutting-edge AI capabilities** to a broader audience, fostering a more
equitable digital landscape.

### Advantages of Livepeer's AI Subnet

- **Decentralization**: Enhances security and resilience by eliminating single
  points of failure.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Expected to provide AI inference capabilities at a
  significantly lower cost compared to traditional cloud services.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales in response to user demand, ensuring reliable
  service without interruptions.
- **Open-Source Innovation**: Encourages collaborative development, accelerating
  innovation and broadening the range of supported applications.

### How It Works

The AI Subnet, built on the established Livepeer network, leverages a 
**decentralized payment infrastructure** for compensating AI orchestrator nodes for performing AI inference tasks. 
The network consists of two primary actors:

- **AI Gateway Nodes**: These nodes manage the flow of AI tasks from
  applications and users, directing them to the appropriate Orchestrator nodes
  based on capability and current load, ensuring efficient task allocation and
  system scalability.

- **AI Orchestrator Nodes**: These nodes manage the execution of AI tasks. They
  can perform AI inference tasks on GPUs located on the same machine or be
  connected to multiple machines with multiple GPUs, known as **AI Worker
  Nodes**. The orchestrator or its worker nodes keep AI models
  [warm](/ai/pipelines/overview#warm-models) on their GPUs for immediate
  processing and can
  [dynamically load models](/ai/pipelines/overview#on-demand-models) as tasks
  arrive, optimizing both response time and resource utilization.

This architecture is designed for **scalability**, enabling easy integration of
additional Orchestrator and Gateway nodes as demand increases. Under the hood,
it relies on a specialized
[ai-runner Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/ai-runner) image to execute
inference requests on AI models, simplifying deployment and enhancing the
scalability of new pipelines. Ongoing developments aim to enhance
**performance** and **broaden the container's capabilities** to support
increasingly complex AI models and custom user-defined pipelines.

Below is a simplified diagram illustrating the **complete AI inference
pipeline** within the Livepeer AI Subnet. Only one AI Orchestrator
with one GPU on the same machine is shown for clarity. In reality, the AI Gateway is
connected to multiple Orchestrators, each of which can have multiple worker
nodes with various GPUs attached.

```mermaid

    A[AI Gateway Node] -->|Task Routing| B[AI Orchestrator Node]
    B -->|Tasks Execution| C[ai-runner Docker Container]
    C -->|Uses Pre-loaded Model| D[GPU Ready/Warm Models]
    C -->|Dynamically Loads Model| E[GPU On-Demand]
    D -->|Perform Inference| G[Task Completion]
    E -->|Perform Inference| G
    G -->|Return Results| B
    B -->|Send Results Back| A

```

This flow starts at the AI Gateway nodes, which route tasks from applications or
users to an appropriate AI Orchestrator node. The selection of the AI
Orchestrator node is based on factors such as the speed of previous
inference requests, orchestrator stake, advertised price, and more. The AI
Orchestrator node then executes the task in the ai-runner Docker Container. In
this container, the AI Orchestrator can either:

- **Pre-load a model**: Orchestrators keep frequently used models
  [warm](ai/pipelines/overview#warm-models) on GPUs, speeding up task
  processing.
- **Dynamically load a model**: Orchestrators can
  [load models on demand](ai/pipelines/overview#on-demand-models), allowing
  flexibility to handle various tasks.

During the selection process, to ensure quick response times, Gateways first
check if there are any Orchestrators available with the requested model 'warm'
on their GPU. If not, they route the task to an Orchestrator that can
dynamically load the model. Once the model is loaded, the task is executed on
the GPU, and the results are returned to the Orchestrator node, which then sends
them back to the Gateway node and finally to the application or user that
requested the task. This architecture ensures the AI Subnet is both
**efficient** and **flexible**, ready to scale and adapt to various AI
applications.

### Explore Generative AI Pipelines

The AI Subnet hosts a variety of generative AI pipelines, each supporting
different models. Current offerings primarily utilize
[Diffusion models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index). Plans are in
place to expand support to include other model types in future updates.

### Current Limitations and Future Directions

- **Alpha Phase**: The AI Subnet is currently in its Alpha phase, and users may
  encounter bugs or issues during this early stage. It is not yet meant to be
  used with high demand production workloads.
- **Supports Limited Set of Open-source Models**: The AI Subnet currently
  supports a limited set of AI models and pipelines that are open-source and
  available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models). However, this
  range is gradually expanding with the goal of supporting any custom model in
  the future.
- **Only Higher VRAM GPUs Supported**: Currently, the AI Subnet requires GPUs
  with at least 16GB of VRAM to run AI inference tasks effectively. We are
  working to expand this support to lower VRAM GPUs in the future.

### AI Subnet Terminology

- **Mainnet Transcoding Network**: Comprises Orchestrator and Gateway nodes that
  perform or coordinate transcoding tasks.
- **AI Subnet (also known as AI Video Subnet)**: A specialized subnet within the
  Livepeer network designed for managing AI inference tasks.
- **Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator**: A node that handles transcoding
  tasks within the Mainnet Transcoding Network. Often referred to as
  _Orchestrator_.
- **Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway**: A node that routes transcoding tasks
  to the appropriate Orchestrator nodes. Often referred to as _Gateway_ and
  formerly known as Broadcaster.
- **AI Orchestrator**: A specialized node responsible for executing AI inference
  tasks within the AI Subnet.
- **AI Gateway**: A specialized node that directs AI tasks to the appropriate AI
  Orchestrator nodes within the AI Subnet.
