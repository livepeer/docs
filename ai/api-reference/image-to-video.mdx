  The public [Livepeer.cloud](https://www.livepeer.cloud/) Gateway used in this
  guide is intended for experimentation and is not guaranteed for production
  use. It is a free, non-token-gated, but rate-limited service designed for
  testing purposes. For production-ready applications, consider setting up your
  own Gateway node or partnering with one via the `ai-video` channel on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
