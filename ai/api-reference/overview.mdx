Welcome to the Livepeer AI API reference docs! Here you'll find all the
endpoints exposed on the standard Livepeer AI API, learn how to use them and
what they return.

The Livepeer API is organized around REST, has predictable resource-oriented
URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses
standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

There are multiple gateway providers active in the ecosystem that can be used to interact with the Livepeer AI network. For more details, visit the [AI Gateways](/ai/builders/gateways) page.
