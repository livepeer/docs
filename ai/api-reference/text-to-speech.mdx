<Info>
  The default Gateway used in this guide is the public
  [Livepeer.cloud](https://www.livepeer.cloud/) Gateway. It is free to use but
  not intended for production-ready applications. For production-ready
  applications, consider using the [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio/)
  Gateway, which requires an API token. Alternatively, you can set up your own
  Gateway node or partner with one via the `ai-video` channel on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/livepeer).

  Please note that the exact parameters, default values, and responses may vary
  between models. For more information on model-specific parameters, please
  refer to the respective model documentation available in the [text-to-speech
  pipeline](/ai/pipelines/text-to-speech). Not all parameters might be available
  for a given model.
