### On-chain Setup

In the previous section, we covered the **off-chain** configuration of your AI
Gateway node. This section will explain how to connect your AI Gateway to the
Livepeer AI network to start requesting AI inference jobs **on-chain**.

## Prerequisites

- A dedicated static IP address or domain name for your AI Gateway node
- A funded Ethereum account with enough ETH to cover gas fees and AI inference
  job payments

## Launching your On-chain AI Gateway

Once your AI Gateway is set up **off-chain**, it's time to connect it to the
Livepeer AI network for **on-chain** inference jobs. The process is similar to
setting up a Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway, with a few extra flags
specific to Livepeer AI. You can refer to the
[Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) guide
for more information. Here’s a summary of the key steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Off-chain AI Gateway">
    Ensure your AI Gateway node is functioning correctly **off-chain** before connecting it to the Livepeer AI network. Refer to [the previous section](/ai/gateways/start-gateway) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare your Ethereum account">
    Make sure your Ethereum account has enough ETH to cover gas fees and AI inference job payments. For more details, see the [Fund Gateway Guide](/gateways/guides/fund-gateway).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund your AI Gateway">
    Deposit enough funds into your AI Gateway to cover the **deposit** and **reserve** needed for AI inference requests. Follow the steps in the [Deposit Gateway Funds via Livepeer CLI](/gateways/guides/fund-gateway#deposit-gateway-funds-via-livepeer-cli) guide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Transcoding Options">
    Configure transcoding options even though the AI Gateway doesn’t handle transcoding, due to current Livepeer AI software requirements. See the [Transcoding Options](/gateways/guides/transcoding-options) guide for more information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the AI Gateway">
    Now launch your AI Gateway node. The process is similar to the **docker** or **binary** setup in the [previous section](/ai/gateways/start-gateway), but requires additional flags to enable on-chain functionality. Example:

    - `-network=arbitrum-one-mainnet`: Connects the AI Gateway to the Arbitrum Mainnet network.
    - `-ethUrl=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`: Sets the Arbitrum Mainnet RPC URL. Replace it with your own if necessary.
    - `-ethKeystorePath=/root/.lpData/arbitrum-one-mainnet/keystore`: Sets the path to the Ethereum keystore file for the AI Gateway.
    - `-ethAcctAddr <LIVEPEER_AI_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: Sets the Ethereum account address for the AI Gateway.
    - `-ethPassword=/root/.lpData/.eth_secret`: Sets the path to the Ethereum keystore password file.
    - `-ethOrchAddr=<MAIN_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: Sets the Ethereum address of the Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway.
    - `-maxTotalEV=100000000000000`: Ensures the AI Gateway complies with the max ticket value limits in `go-livepeer`.

  </Step>
