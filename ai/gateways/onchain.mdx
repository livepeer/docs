title: On-chain Setup
---

The previous section covered the **off-chain** configuration of the AI Gateway
node. This section will explain how to connect an AI Gateway node to the AI
subnet and request AI inference jobs on-chain.

## Prerequisites

- A dedicated static IP address or domain name for your AI Gateway node
- A funded Ethereum account with enough ETH to cover gas fees and pay for AI
  inference jobs

## Launch your On-chain AI Gateway

After setting up your AI Gateway **off-chain**, it's time to connect it to the
AI Subnet for on-chain AI inference jobs. This process is similar to the Mainnet
Transcoding Network Gateway setup, with a few extra flags due to AI Subnet
software limitations. See the
[Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) guide
for details. Below is a summary:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Off-chain AI Gateway">
    Verify that your AI Gateway node is functioning correctly **off-chain** before connecting it to the AI Subnet. Refer to [the previous section](/ai/gateways/start-gateway) for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare your Ethereum account">
    Ensure your Ethereum account has enough ETH to cover gas fees and AI inference jobs. Refer to the [Fund Gateway Guide](/gateways/guides/fund-gateway) for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund your AI Gateway">
    Fund your AI Gateway to ensure it has sufficient **deposit** and **reserve** to pay for AI inference requests. Refer to the [Deposit Gateway Funds via Livepeer CLI](/gateways/guides/fund-gateway#deposit-gateway-funds-via-livepeer-cli) guide for more information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Transcoding Options">
    Configure transcoding options, even though the AI Gateway is not a transcoding node, due to current AI Subnet software limitations. Refer to the [Transcoding Options](/gateways/guides/transcoding-options) guide for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch an AI Gateway">
    Launch your AI Gateway node. This process is similar to the **docker** or **binary** steps in the [previous section](/ai/gateways/start-gateway), but requires additional flags to enable on-chain functionality. Here's an example:

    - `-network=arbitrum-one-mainnet`: This flag connects the AI Gateway node to the Arbitrum Mainnet network.
    - `-ethUrl=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`: This flag sets the Arbitrum Mainnet RPC URL. Replace this with your own RPC URL if needed.
    - `-ethKeystorePath=/root/.lpData/arbitrum-one-mainnet/keystore`: This flag sets the path to the AI Gateway's Ethereum keystore file.
    - `-ethAcctAddr <AI_SUBNET_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: This flag sets the Ethereum address of the AI Gateway.
    - `-ethPassword=/root/.lpData/.eth_secret`: This flag sets the path to the Ethereum keystore password file.
    - `-ethOrchAddr=<MAIN_ORCH_ETH_ADDRESS>`: This flag sets the Ethereum address of the Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway.
    - `-maxTotalEV=100000000000000`: This flag ensures that the AI Gateway doesn't trigger maximum total ticket value limits set by the `go-livepeer` software.

  </Step>
