If you're exploring joining the AI Subnet as a Gateway (formerly known as a
_Broadcaster_) to perform **AI inference task routing** on the Livepeer network
and provide inference services to customers, this guide is for you. It's
tailored to help you navigate the setup process of an AI Gateway node, mirroring
the [Gateway Setup Guide](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) for the Mainnet
Transcoding Network, but with adjustments for AI operations. Dive into the
subpages for a step-by-step walkthrough. The
[Gateway Setup Guide](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) is your go-to resource
for a deeper understanding of Gateway operations.
