If you're interested in joining Livepeer AI as a **Gateway** (formerly known as
a _Broadcaster_) to perform **AI inference task routing** and provide inference
services to customers, this guide is for you. It builds on the
[Gateway Setup Guide](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) for the Mainnet
Transcoding Network, with additional steps specific to AI operations.

Dive into the **subpages** for a step-by-step walkthrough of the AI-specific
setup. For foundational knowledge on general Gateway operations, refer to the
[Gateway Setup Guide](/gateways/guides/gateway-overview). This guide extends it
with the steps needed for AI task routing.
