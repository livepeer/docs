title: Start your AI Gateway
---

The Livepeer AI Network is not yet integrated into the main
[go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer) software due to its
**Alpha** status. To enable AI inference capabilities on your Gateway node,
please use the `ai-video` branch of
[go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/ai-video). This
branch contains the necessary software for the AI Gateway node. Currently, there
are two methods to run the Livepeer AI Network software:

- **Docker**: This is the most straightforward and recommended method to run the
  AI Gateway node.
- **Pre-built Binaries**: If you prefer not to use Docker, pre-built binaries
  are available.

## Start the AI Gateway

Please follow the steps below to start your AI Livepeer AI Network Gateway node:

    <Tab title="Use Docker (Recommended)">
        <Steps>
            <Step title="Retrieve the Livepeer AI Network Docker Image">
                Fetch the latest Livepeer AI Network Docker image from the [Livepeer Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/go-livepeer) with the following command:

                ```bash
                docker pull livepeer/go-livepeer:ai-video
                ```
            </Step>
            <Step title="Launch an (Offchain) AI Gateway">
                Execute the Livepeer AI Network Docker image using the following command:

                ```bash
                docker run \
                    --name livepeer_ai_gateway \
                    -v ~/.lpData2/:/root/.lpData2 \
                    -p 8937:8937 \
                    --network host \
                    livepeer/go-livepeer:ai-video \
                    -datadir ~/.lpData2 \
                    -gateway \
                    -orchAddr <ORCH_LIST> \
                    -httpAddr 0.0.0.0:8937 \
                    -v 6 \
                    -httpIngest
                ```

                This launches an **offchain** AI Gateway node. The flags are similar to those used for a Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway node. For more information, see the [go-livepeer CLI reference](/references/go-livepeer/cli-reference).
            </Step>
            <Step title="Confirm Successful Startup of the AI Gateway">
                If your Livepeer AI Network Gateway node is functioning correctly, you should see the following output:

                ```bash
                I0501 11:07:47.609839       1 mediaserver.go:201] Transcode Job Type: [{P240p30fps16x9 600k 30 0 426x240 16:9 0 0 0s 0 0 0 0} {P360p30fps16x9 1200k 30 0 640x360 16:9 0 0 0s 0 0 0 0}]

                ```
            </Step>
            <Step title="Check Port Availability">
                To make your Livepeer AI Network Gateway node accessible from the internet, you need to configure your network settings. Ensure that port `8937` is unblocked on your machine. Additionally, consider setting up port forwarding on your router, which will allow the Gateway node to be reachable from the internet.

        <Steps>
            {/* TODO: Simplify this step */}
            <Step title="Download the Latest Livepeer AI Network Binary">
                Download the latest Livepeer AI Network binary for your system:

                ```bash
                wget https://build.livepeer.live/go-livepeer/ai-video/latest/livepeer-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz
                ```

                Replace `<OS>` and `<ARCH>` with your system's operating system and architecture. For example, for a Linux system with an AMD64 architecture, the command would be:

                ```bash
                wget https://build.livepeer.live/go-livepeer/ai-video/latest/livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz
                ```

                See the [go-livepeer installation guide](/orchestrators/guides/install-go-livepeer#install-using-a-binary-release) for more information on the available binaries.

                <Info>The windows and MacOS (amd64) binaries of the Livepeer AI Network are not available yet.</Info>
            </Step>
            <Step title="Extract and Configure the Binary">
                Once downloaded, extract the binary to a directory of your choice.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Launch an (Offchain) AI Gateway">
                Run the following command to start your Livepeer AI Network Gateway node:

                ```bash
                ./livepeer \
                    -datadir ~/.lpData2 \
                    -gateway \
                    -orchAddr <ORCH_LIST> \
                    -httpAddr 0.0.0.0:8937 \
                    -v 6 \
                    -httpIngest
                ```

                This command launches an **offchain** AI Gateway node. These flags are similar to running a Mainnet Transcoding Network Gateway node. For more information see the [go-livepeer CLI reference](/references/go-livepeer/cli-reference).

## Confirm the AI Gateway is Operational

After launching the Livepeer AI Network Gateway node, verify its operation by sending an
AI inference request directly to it. This requires an active **off-chain** AI
Orchestrator node. For guidance on setting up an AI Orchestrator node, refer to
the [AI Orchestrator Setup Guide](/ai/orchestrators/get-started).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Launch an AI Orchestrator">
        Start an AI Orchestrator node on port `8936` following the [AI Orchestrator Setup Guide](/ai/orchestrators/get-started). Ensure it has loaded the desired model for inference (e.g., "ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning").
    </Step>
    <Step title="Link Gateway to AI Orchestrator">
        To connect your Gateway node to the AI Orchestrator node, specify the Orchestrator's address when launching the Gateway node. Replace `<ORCH_LIST>` with the Orchestrator's address, like so:

        ```bash
        -orchAddr 0.0.0.0:8936
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Submit an Inference Request">
        Refer to the [AI API reference](/ai/api-reference/text-to-image) to understand how to submit an inference request to the Gateway node. For instance, to generate an image from text, use the following `curl` command:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:8937/text-to-image" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
                "model_id":"ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning",
                "prompt":"A cool cat on the beach",
                "width": 1024,
                "height": 1024
            }'
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inspect the Response">
        If the Gateway node is functioning correctly, you should receive a response similar to the following:

        ```json
        {
            "images": [
                {
                "seed": 2562822894,
                "url": "https://0.0.0.0:8937/stream/d0fc1fc6/8fdf5a94.png"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        Consult the [Text-to-image Pipeline Documentation](/ai/pipelines/text-to-image) for more details on interpreting the response.
    </Step>
