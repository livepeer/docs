title: Building on Livepeer AI

Livepeer AI, now in its **Beta** phase, is fully operational and already
powering a diverse range of cutting-edge [applications](/ai/builders/showcase).
Developers are actively building on the platform, with a rapidly growing
community. While the network continues to evolve with frequent updates, its
stable foundation offers an exciting space for innovation. With a variety of
[easy-to-use client SDKs](/ai/sdks/overview), developers can dive in and start
shaping the future of AI-powered solutions.
