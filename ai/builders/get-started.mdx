title: Building on the AI Subnet
---

The AI Subnet, currently in its **Alpha** stage, is fully operational and
already hosts several quality applications. At this stage, efforts are concentrated on
**network optimization** and **user experience enhancement**. While official
SDKs are still under development, developers can interact directly with the AI
subnet using the endpoints exposed by Livepeer network Gateway nodes. For a
comprehensive understanding of the AI Subnet endpoints and to experiment with
the API, please refer to the
[AI Subnet API Reference](/ai/api-reference/text-to-image).
