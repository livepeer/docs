title: Get Started
---

It's fantastic to see interest in contributing to the Livepeer AI Subnet! There
are many ways to contribute, and excitement is high to build a decentralized AI
ecosystem together ‚ù§Ô∏è. Here are a few ways to get started:

- **Orchestrators**: With GPUs that have at least 16GB of VRAM, contribution is
  possible by setting up an AI Orchestrator node and processing AI tasks on the
  AI Subnet. Check out the
  [Orchestrator Setup Guide](/ai/orchestrators/get-started) page to learn more.
- **Gateways**: Server hardware can be used to connect customers to the AI
  Subnet by setting up an AI Gateway node. Check out the
  [Set up AI Gateway](/ai/gateways/setup-gateway) page to learn more.
- **Founder**: Founders can contribute by building AI applications on the AI
  Subnet. Check out the [Build on the AI Subnet](/ai/builders) page to learn
  more.
- **Developers**: Open Source Developers can contribute by improving the AI
  Subnet codebase. Check out the guide on
  [Contributing to the AI Subnet](/ai/contribute-to-ai-subnet) to learn more.

For any questions or help needed, reach out in the `ai-video` channel of the
[Livepeer Discord](https://discord.gg/7w2R6v). Support is available to help get
started and along the way. Let's build together! üöÄ
