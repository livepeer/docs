Adding support for a new model to Livepeer AI offers the opportunity to expand
its capabilities and provide more options for developers to build on top of the
Livepeer network. This guide will walk you through the steps to add a new model
to Livepeer AI.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Adding a new pipeline to Livepeer AI is more involved than
[adding a new model](ai/contribute/guides), but it is still relatively
straightforward. To add a new pipeline, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Fork the AI Worker Repository**: Fork the [Livepeer AI Worker]() repository
   to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Pipeline**: Create a new pipeline in the `runner/pipelines`
   directory. You can use the existing pipelines as a reference. To get started,
   you can use the template files in the `runner/examples` directory.
4. **Create a New Route**: Create a new route in the `runner/routes` directory
   to handle the API requests for the new pipeline. To get started, you can use
   the template files in the `runner/examples` directory.

<Tip>
  The best way to develop the AI Worker is by using the [VScode Dev
  Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
  provided in the repository. This will allow you to debug and test your changes
  in a consistent environment. For more information, see [the runner dev
  documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dev/README.md).
