title: Add new Pipeline
---

Adding support for a new model to the AI subnet offers the opportunity to expand
the capabilities of the AI subnet and provide more options for developers to
build on top of the Livepeer network. This guide will walk you through the steps
to add a new model to the AI subnet.

## Video Guide

In this video, one of the Livepeer ecosytem's core Developers will walk you
through the steps to add a new pipeline to the AI Subnet.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Adding a new pipeline to the AI Subnet is a bit more involved than
[adding a new model](ai/contribute/guides), but it is still relatively
straightforward. To add a new pipeline, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Fork the AI Worker Repository**: Fork the [Livepeer AI Worker]() repository
   to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Pipeline**: Create a new pipeline in the `runner/pipelines`
   directory. You can use the existing pipelines as a reference. You can use the
   template files in the `runner/examples` directory to get started.
4. **Create a New Route**: Create a new route in the `runner/routes` directory
   to handle the API requests for the new pipeline. You can use the template
   files in the `runner/examples` directory to get started.

<Tip>
  The best way to develop on the AI Worker is by using the [VScode Dev
  Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
  provided in the repository. This will allow you to debug and test your changes
  in a consistent environment. For more information see [the runner dev
  documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dev/README.md).
