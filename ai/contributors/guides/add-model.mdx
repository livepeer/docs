Adding support for a new model to the AI subnet is a great way to get started
with contributing to the Livepeer AI Subnet. This guide will walk you through
the steps to add a new model to the AI Subnet.

## Video Guide

In this video, one of the Livepeer ecosytem's core Developers will walk you
through the steps to add a new model to the AI Subnet.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Adding a new model to the AI Subnet is relatively straightforward since each of
the supported [pipelines](/ai/guides/add-pipeline) is designed to support
multiple diffusion models in the respective diffusion pipeline. To add a new
model, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Fork the AI Worker Repository**: Fork the
   [Livepeer AI Worker](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker) repository to
   your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Find a Model**: Find a diffusion model from
   [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-video)
   that you would like to add to the AI Subnet. Replace the `image-to-video`
   pipeline tag in the URL with the pipeline tag of your choice.
4. **Download the Model**: Update the
   [runner/dl_checkpoints.sh](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dl_checkpoints.sh#L73)
   script to download the model weights from Hugging Face.
5. **Set the MODEL_ID env variable**: Set the `MODEL_ID` environment variable to
   the hugging face identifier of the model you want to add.
6. **Run the AI Worker**: Run the AI Worker with the updated
   `runner/dl_checkpoints.sh` script to download the model weights. 6 **Test the
   Model**: Test the model by starting the AI Worker (see the
   [runner README](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/tree/main/runner#readme)).
7. **Make the necessary changes**: If a model does not work natively with the AI
   worker, you may need to make changes to the repsectify pipeline the model is
   in.

<Tip>
  The best way to develop on the AI Worker is by using the [VScode Dev
  Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
  provided in the repository. This will allow you to debug and test your changes
  in a consistent environment. For more information see [the runner dev
  documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dev/README.md).
