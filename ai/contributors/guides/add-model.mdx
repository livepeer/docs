Adding support for a new model to the AI subnet is a great way to get started with contributing to the Livepeer AI Subnet. This guide will walk you through the steps to add a new model to the AI Subnet.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Adding a new model to the AI Subnet is relatively straightforward since each of our supported [pipelines](/ai/guides/add-pipeline) is designed to support multiple diffusion models in the respective diffusion pipeline. To add a new model, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Fork the AI Worker Repository**: Fork the [Livepeer AI Worker](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker) repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Find a Model**: Find a diffusion model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-video) that you would like to add to the AI Subnet. Replace the `image-to-video` pipeline tag in the URL with the pipeline tag of your choice.
3. **Download the Model**: Update the [runner/dl_checkpoints.sh](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dl_checkpoints.sh#L73) script to download the model weights from Hugging Face.
4. **Set the MODEL_ID env variable**: Set the `MODEL_ID` environment variable to the hugging face identifier of the model you want to add.
5. **Run the AI Worker**: Run the AI Worker with the updated `runner/dl_checkpoints.sh` script to download the model weights.
6  **Test the Model**: Test the model by starting the AI Worker (see the [runner README](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/tree/main/runner#readme)).
7. **Make the necessary changes**: If a model does not work natively with the AI worker, you may need to make changes to the repsectify pipeline the model is in.

<Tip>The best way to develop on the AI Worker is by using the [VScode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) provided in the repository. This will allow you to debug and test your changes in a consistent environment. For more information see [the runner dev documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/dev/README.md).</Tip>
