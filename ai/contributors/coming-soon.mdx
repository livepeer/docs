Amazing that you decided to join our open-source community and help us
democratize AI! ðŸŽ‰

All our software is open-source, and anyone can permissionlessly add their AI
compute job to the Livepeer network. We have a strong developer community with a
[core developer group](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management) and tens
of open-source developers. The best way to get in touch with this community and
start developing is by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7w2R6v).

We also offer multiple opportunities for developers to get rewarded for their
contributions, such as our
[grants program](https://livepeer.notion.site/Livepeer-Grants-Program-f91071b5030d4c31ad4dd08e7c026526),
[software bounty program](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties), and
[bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/livepeer/information/) for
security researchers.

Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
