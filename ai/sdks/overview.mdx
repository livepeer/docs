## Client-side SDKs

Client-side SDKs simplify the process of using the Livepeer AI API. Just install
a language-specific SDK into your application, choose a
[AI Gateway](/ai/builders/gateways), and get started with only 2 lines of
code. For some gateways, initialisation with an API key is optional.
