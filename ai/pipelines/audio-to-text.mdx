title: Audio-to-Text

## Overview

The `audio-to-text` pipeline converts audio from media files into text,
utilizing cutting-edge diffusion models from HuggingFace's
[automatic-speech-recognition (ASR) pipeline](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition).

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `audio-to-text` pipeline is:

- [openai/whisper-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3):
  Whisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
  speech translation.

<Tip>
  For faster responses with different
  [audio-to-text](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition)
  diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
  channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

The following models have been tested and verified for the `audio-to-text`
pipeline:

<Note>
  If a specific model you wish to use is not listed, please submit a [feature
  request](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cmodel&projects=&template=model_request.yml)
  on GitHub to get the model verified and added to the list.

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
  For a detailed understanding of the `audio-to-text` endpoint and to experiment
  with the API, see the [Livepeer AI API
  Reference](/ai/api-reference/audio-to-text).
</Tip>

To create an audio transcript using the `audio-to-text` pipeline, submit a
`POST` request to the Gateway's `audio-to-text` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<gateway-ip>/audio-to-text" \
    -F model_id=openai/whisper-large-v3 \
    -F audio=@<PATH_TO_FILE>
```

In this command:

- `<gateway-ip>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model for image generation.
- `audio` is the path to the audio file to be transcribed.

<Note>
  - Supported file types: `mp4`, `webm`, `mp3`, `flac`, `wav` and `m4a` -
  Maximum request size: 50 MB
</Note>

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[Livepeer AI API Reference](/ai/api-reference/audio-to-text).

After execution, the Orchestrator processes the request and returns the response
to the Gateway:

```json
{
    "chunks": [
        {
            "text": " Explore the power of automatic speech recognition",
            "timestamp": [
                0,
                1.35
            ]
        },
        {
            "text": " By extracting the text from audio",
            "timestamp": [
                1.35
                2.07
            ]
        }
    ],
    "text": " Explore the power of automatic speech recognition By extracting the text from audio"
}
```
