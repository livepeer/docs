title: Audio-to-Text

## Overview

The `audio-to-text` pipeline converts audio from media files into text,
utilizing cutting-edge diffusion models from HuggingFace's
[automatic-speech-recognition (ASR) pipeline](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition).

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `audio-to-text` pipeline is:

- [openai/whisper-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3):
  Whisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
  speech translation.

<Tip>
  For faster responses with different
  [audio-to-text](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition)
  diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
  channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

The following models have been tested and verified for the `audio-to-text`
pipeline:

<Note>
  If a specific model you wish to use is not listed, please submit a [feature
  request](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cmodel&projects=&template=model_request.yml)
  on GitHub to get the model verified and added to the list.

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
  For a detailed understanding of the `audio-to-text` endpoint and to experiment
  with the API, see the [Livepeer AI API
  Reference](/ai/api-reference/audio-to-text).
</Tip>

To create an audio transcript using the `audio-to-text` pipeline, submit a
`POST` request to the Gateway's `audio-to-text` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/audio-to-text" \
    -F model_id=openai/whisper-large-v3 \
    -F audio=@<PATH_TO_FILE>
```

In this command:

- `<GATEWAY_IP>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model for audio transcription.
- `audio` is the path to the audio file to be transcribed.

<Note>
  - Supported file types: `mp4`, `webm`, `mp3`, `flac`, `wav` and `m4a` -
  Maximum request size: 50 MB
</Note>

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[Livepeer AI API Reference](/ai/api-reference/audio-to-text).

After execution, the Orchestrator processes the request and returns the response
to the Gateway:

```json
{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text": " Explore the power of automatic speech recognition",
      "timestamp": [0, 1.35]
    },
    {
      "text": " By extracting the text from audio",
      "timestamp": [1.35, 2.07]
    }
  ],
  "text": " Explore the power of automatic speech recognition By extracting the text from audio"
}
```

## Orchestrator Configuration

To configure your Orchestrator to serve the `audio-to-text` pipeline, refer to
the [Orchestrator Configuration](/ai/orchestrators/get-started) guide.

### System Requirements

The following system requirements are recommended for optimal performance:

- [NVIDIA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) with **at least 12GB** of
  VRAM.

## Recommended Pipeline Pricing

<Note>We are planning to simplify the pricing in the future so orchestrators can set 
one AI price per compute unit and have the system automatically scale based on the 
model's compute requirements.</Note>

The pricing for the `audio-to-text` pipeline is based on competitor pricing. However, 
we strongly encourage orchestrators to set their own pricing based on their costs and 
requirements. Setting a competitive price will help attract more jobs, as Gateways can 
set their maximum price for a job. The current recommended pricing for this pipeline 
is `0.02e-6 USD` per **milliseconds** of input.
