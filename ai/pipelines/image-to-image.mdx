## Overview

The `image-to-image` pipeline of the AI Subnet enables **advanced image
manipulations** including style transfer, image enhancement, and more. This
pipeline leverages cutting-edge diffusion models from the HuggingFace
[image-to-image](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-image)
pipeline.

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `image-to-image` pipeline is:

- [timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix](https://huggingface.co/timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix):
  A powerful diffusion model that edits images to a high-quality standard based
  on human-written instructions

<Tip>
  For faster responses with different
  [image-to-image](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-image)
  diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
  channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

The following models have been tested and verified for the `image-to-image`
pipeline:

<Note>
  If a specific model you wish to use is not listed, please submit a [feature
  request](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cmodel&projects=&template=model_request.yml)
  on GitHub to get the model verified and added to the list.

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
  For a detailed understanding of the `image-to-image` endpoint and to
  experiment with the API, see the [AI Subnet API
  Reference](/ai/api-reference/image-to-image).
</Tip>

To generate an image with the `image-to-image` pipeline, send a `POST` request
to the Gateway's `image-to-image` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<gateway-ip>/image-to-image \
    -F model_id="ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning" \
    -F image=@<PATH_TO_IMAGE>/cool-cat.png \
    -F prompt="a hat"
```

In this command:

- `<gateway-ip>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model for image generation.
- The `image` field holds the **absolute** path to the image file to be
  transformed.
- `prompt` is the text description for the image.

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[AI Subnet API Reference](/ai/api-reference/image-to-image).

After execution, the Orchestrator processes the request and returns the response
to the Gateway:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "nsfw": false,
      "seed": 3197613440,
      "url": "https://<gateway-ip>/stream/dd5ad78d/7adde483.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `url` in the response is the URL of the generated image. Download the image
with:

```bash
curl -O "https://<STORAGE_ENDPOINT>/stream/dd5ad78d/7adde483.png"
```
