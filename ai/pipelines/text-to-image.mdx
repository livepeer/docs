title: Text-to-Image
---

## Overview

The `text-to-image` pipeline of the Livepeer AI network allows you to generate
**high-quality** images from text descriptions. This pipeline is powered by the
latest diffusion models in the HuggingFace
[text-to-image](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image)
pipeline.

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `text-to-image` pipeline is:

- [SG161222/RealVisXL_V4.0_Lightning](https://huggingface.co/SG161222/RealVisXL_V4.0_Lightning):  
  A streamlined version of RealVisXL_V4.0, designed for faster inference while
  still aiming for photorealism.

Furthermore, several Orchestrators are currently maintaining the following model
in a ready state:

- [ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning):  
  A high-performance diffusion model developed by ByteDance.

<Tip>
  For faster responses with different
  [text-to-video](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-video)
  diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
  channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
  For a detailed understanding of the `text-to-image` endpoint and to experiment
  with the API, see the [Livepeer AI API
  Reference](/ai/api-reference/text-to-image). For examples of effective
  prompts, visit [PromptHero](https://prompthero.com/).
</Tip>

To generate an image with the `text-to-image` pipeline, send a `POST` request to
the Gateway's `text-to-image` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/text-to-image" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model_id":"ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning",
        "prompt":"A cool cat on the beach",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024
    }'
```

In this command:

- `<GATEWAY_IP>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model for image generation.
- `prompt` is the text description for the image.

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[Livepeer AI API Reference](/ai/api-reference/text-to-image).

After execution, the Orchestrator processes the request and returns the response
to the Gateway:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "nsfw": false,
      "seed": 2562822894,
      "url": "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/stream/d0fc1fc6/8fdf5a94.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `url` in the response is the URL of the generated image. Download the image
with:

```bash
curl -O "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/stream/d0fc1fc6/8fdf5a94.png"
```

## Applying LoRa Models

To apply LoRa filters to an image, include the `loras` field in your request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/text-to-image" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model_id":"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
        "prompt":"A cool cat on the beach",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024,
        "loras": "{ \"latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdxl\": 1.0, \"nerijs/pixel-art-xl\": 1.2}"
    }'
```

You can find a list of available LoRa models for various models on
[lora-studio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/enzostvs/lora-studio).

## Orchestrator Configuration

To configure your Orchestrator to serve the `text-to-image` pipeline, refer to
the [Orchestrator Configuration](/ai/orchestrators/get-started) guide.

### System Requirements

The following system requirements are recommended for optimal performance:

- [NVIDIA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) with **at least 24GB** of
  VRAM.
