## Overview

The `segment-anything-2` pipeline provides direct access to the
[Segment Anything 2 pipeline](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/) developed by
[Meta AI Research](https://research.facebook.com/). In its current version, it
supports only image segmentation, enabling it to segment any object in an image.
Future versions will also support direct video input, allowing the object to be
consistently tracked across all frames of a video in real-time. This advancement
will unlock new possibilities for video editing and enhance experiences in mixed
reality. The pipeline is powered by the latest diffusion models from
HuggingFace's
[facebook/sam2-hiera-large](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-large).

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `segment-anything-2` pipeline is:

- [facebook/sam2-hiera-large](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-large):
  The largest model in the Segment Anything 2 model suite, designed for the most
  accurate image segmentation.

<Tip>
  For faster responses with different
  [segment-anything-2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2)
  diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
  channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

The following models have been tested and verified for the `segment-anything-2`
pipeline:

<Note>
  If a specific model you wish to use is not listed, please submit a [feature
  request](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cmodel&projects=&template=model_request.yml)
  on GitHub to get the model verified and added to the list.

<Accordion title="Tested and Verified Diffusion Models">
- [facebook/sam2-hiera-base-plus](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-base-plus): The second largest model in the Segment Anything 2 model suite, providing a balance between speed and accuracy.
- [facebook/sam2-hiera-small](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-small): A smaller model in the Segment Anything 2 model suite, designed for faster image segmentation.
- [facebook/sam2-hiera-tiny](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-tiny): The smallest model in the Segment Anything 2 model suite, optimized for real-time image segmentation.

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
  For a detailed understanding of the `segment-anything-2` endpoint and to
  experiment with the API, see the [AI Subnet API
  Reference](/ai/api-reference/segment-anything-2).
</Tip>

To generate an image with the `segment-anything-2` pipeline, send a `POST`
request to the Gateway's `segment-anything-2` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<gateway-ip>/segment-anything-2 \
    -F model_id="facebook/sam2-hiera-large" \
    -F point_coords="[[120,100],[120,50]]" \
    -F point_labels="[1,0]" \
    -F image=@<PATH_TO_IMAGE>/cool-cat.png
```

In this command:

- `<gateway-ip>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model for image generation.
- The `point_coords` field holds the coordinates of the points to be segmented.
- The `point_labels` field holds the labels for the points to be segmented.
- The `image` field holds the **absolute** path to the image file to be
  transformed.

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[AI Subnet API Reference](/ai/api-reference/segment-anything-2).

After execution, the Orchestrator processes the request and returns the response
to the Gateway:

```json
{
  "masks": "[[[2.84, 2.83, ...], [2.92, 2.91, ...], [3.22, 3.56, ...], ...]]",
  "scores": "[0.50, 0.37, ...]",
  "logits": "[[[2.84, 2.66, ...], [3.59, 5.20, ...], [5.07, 5.68, ...], ...]]"
}
```
