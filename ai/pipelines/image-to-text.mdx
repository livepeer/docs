## Overview

The `image-to-text` pipeline converts images into text captions. This pipeline is powered by the latest models in the HuggingFace [text-to-image](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image) pipeline.

## Models

### Warm Models

The current warm model requested for the `image-to-text` pipeline is:

- [Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large)

<Tip>
    For faster responses with different
    [image-to-text](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image)
    diffusion models, ask Orchestrators to load it on their GPU via the `ai-video`
    channel in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/livepeer).
</Tip>

### On-Demand Models

The following models have been tested and verified for the `image-to-text`
pipeline:

<Note>
    If a specific model you wish to use is not listed, please submit a [feature
    request](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cmodel&projects=&template=model_request.yml)
    on GitHub to get the model verified and added to the list.

## Basic Usage Instructions

<Tip>
    For a detailed understanding of the `image-to-text` endpoint and to experiment
    with the API, see the [Livepeer AI API
    Reference](/ai/api-reference/image-to-text).
</Tip>

To create an image caption using the `image-to-text` pipeline, submit a
`POST` request to the Gateway's `image-to-text` API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<GATEWAY_IP>/image-to-text" \
    -F model_id=Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large \
    -F image=@<PATH_TO_FILE>
```

In this command:

- `<GATEWAY_IP>` should be replaced with your AI Gateway's IP address.
- `model_id` is the diffusion model to use.
- `image` is the path to the image file to be captioned.

<Note>
    Maximum request size: 50 MB
</Note>

For additional optional parameters, refer to the
[Livepeer AI API Reference](/ai/api-reference/image-to-text).

## Orchestrator Configuration

To configure your Orchestrator to serve the `image-to-text` pipeline, refer to
the [Orchestrator Configuration](/ai/orchestrators/get-started) guide.

### System Requirements

The following system requirements are recommended for optimal performance:

- [NVIDIA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) with **at least 12GB** of
VRAM.
