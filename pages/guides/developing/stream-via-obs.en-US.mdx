# Stream via OBS

The purpose of this guide is to allow you to get a more in-depth look at setting
up a livestream using Livepeer Studio with OBS. In order to broadcast a live
stream, you’ll need a stream key.

## Introduction

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the way that many users stream into Livepeer
because it is easy to use, open source, and offers a high degree of customization.

## Prepare the environment

- Download [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
- Login or sign up at [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio)
- [Create a stream](./create-a-livestream)

## Open OBS and create a source

1. Click the **+ icon** under sources and select **Video Capture Device** if
   you’d like to stream using a camera or webcam. If you’d like to stream a
   browser window, select **Window Capture**.
2. Give the device a name:

  Livepeer Studio works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally
  2 seconds. You should set or encourage your users to set this in their
  broadcasting software.
