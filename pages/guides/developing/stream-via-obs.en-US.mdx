# Stream via OBS

The purpose of this guide is to allow you to get a more in-depth look at setting
up a livestream using Livepeer Studio with OBS. In order to broadcast a live
stream, you’ll need a stream key.

## Introduction

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the way that many users stream into Livepeer
because it is easy to use, open source, and offers a high degree of customization.

## Prepare the environment

- Download [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
- Login or sign up at [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio)
- Create a stream by navigating to "Streams", clicking "Create stream", and giving the stream a name.
- Copy the **RTMP ingest URL** and **Stream Key** in the stream detail view. You'll need these to start streaming in OBS.

## Open OBS and create a source

1. Click the **+ icon** under sources and select **Video Capture Device** if
   you’d like to stream using a camera or webcam. If you’d like to stream a
   browser window, select **Window Capture**.
2. Give the device a name:

## Input Your Stream Settings

1. Select **Stream** settings.
2. Select **Custom** for services.
3. Paste the **RTMP ingest URL** and **Stream Key** provided by Livepeer Studio into
   the OBS **“Server”** and **“Stream Key”** fields.

## Select Output Settings and Streaming tab

1. In the Output Mode select `Advanced`.
2. Set the keyframe interval to 2-5 seconds (see the [low latency](#configuring-obs-for-low-latency) section below).
3. Save your settings.

## Stream and Check Output

After saving your settings, OBS will return to the stream console.

1. Press start streaming (from the output you selected when inputting your stream
   settings above).
2. Navigate back to your created stream in Livepeer Studio. It should now appear as "Active."

## Configuring OBS for Low Latency

### Balancing Low Latency with User Experience

Achieving the right balance between low latency and stream quality is essential for providing the best possible user experience.
Two settings that significantly impact your stream quality, latency, and user experience are:

- **Rate Control:** This setting dictates the bitrate or "quality" of the stream. A high amount of bandwidth usually means better
  quality, but keep in mind that your output can never improve the quality of your stream beyond your input.
- **Keyframe Interval:** Video streams consist of full frames and data relative to the full frames. This setting determines how often
  a full frame appears, which heavily influences latency.

#### Optimizing for Low Latency

Low latency is primarily determined by the _keyframe interval_. Having keyframes appear more frequently allows viewers to "hook
onto" a point closer to the actual live point. However, full frames have a higher bit cost, so more bandwidth is needed to
generate a stream of the same quality compared to a lower number of keyframes.

  We also require that the user turns off B-frames for lowest latency. B-frames,
  or bidirectional frames, are a type of video compression frame used in video
  encoding processes. They can improve video compression in certain situations,
  but are not able to be played back in our WebRTC video playback, due to frames
  appearing out-of-order.

#### Optimizing for Stream Quality and User Experience

Stream quality and user experience are mainly decided by the rate control of the stream. When optimizing for user experience,
consider the stability of the video playback and the smoothness of the video. This is mostly decided by the peak bitrate of
the video. A high peak bitrate can cause playback problems like buffering or skips in video playback for some viewers.

### Recommended OBS Settings

The following profiles provide a good starting point for balancing low latency with stream quality and user experience.
You may need to adjust the settings to suit your specific situation.

#### Constant Bitrate

This profile offers a good mix between quality and latency, making it suitable for most situations.

```python filename="Constant Bitrate Profile"
Rate Control: CBR
Bit Rate: 2000
Keyframe Interval: 2
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
No additional x264 options
```

#### Constant Quality

This profile prioritizes maintaining a certain level of quality without being too concerned about the bitrate.

```python filename="Constant Quality Profile"
Rate Control: CRF
CRF: 25
Keyframe Interval: 2
CPU Usage Preset: Very fast
Profile: High
Tune: None
No additional x264 options
```

Since Livepeer is mostly HLS-based, a 2-second keyframe interval is generally encouraged, as HLS has a minimum latency of around 3-5
keyframe intervals. This choice would prioritize low latency.

However, if the connection is fairly poor, a 5-second keyframe interval will allow for higher quality per bit at the expense
of more latency. If quality is valued over latency, this is a better choice, and you could even consider going for longer
intervals. It is essential to understand the impact of each setting and adapt them to your specific requirements and priorities.
The optimal stream settings may vary depending on your specific requirements.
