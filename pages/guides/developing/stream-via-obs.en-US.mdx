title: Stream via OBS
---

The purpose of this guide is to allow you to get a more in-depth look at setting
up a livestream using Livepeer Studio with OBS.

## About Streaming via [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the way that most users stream into Livepeer
because it is easy to use and offers a high degree of customization.

## Methods to Stream via [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

- Livestreaming with a broadcasting software

## Prepare the environment

- Download [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
- Login or Sign up for a [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio) account
- [Create a stream](https://livepeer.studio/preview/blog/stream-into-livepeer-studio-first-time)

## Open OBS and create a source

1. Click the **+ icon** under sources and select **Video Capture Device** if
   you’d like to stream using a camera or webcam. If you’d like to stream a
   browser window, select **Window Capture**.
2. Give the device a name

## Input Your Stream Settings

1. Select **Stream** settings
1. Select **custom** for services
1. Copy and paste the **RTMP ingest URL** and **Stream Key** and paste it into
   the **“Server”** and **“Stream Key”** fields.

- `RTMP ingest URL` and Stream Key can be found on the dashboard on the Stream
  Detail page after creating a stream or in the API.

## Stream and Check Output

After saving your settings, OBS will return to the stream console.

1. Press start streaming from the output you selected when inputting your stream
   settings above.

2. Navigate to the Livepeer Dashboard, login, and select the stream name that
   you are currently using. This should now be marked as “Active.”

3. Under the Health tab, the video you are streaming in through OBS should be
   visible.

**For Example:**

## Previewing a Stream in a Browser

There are several options to display the livestream in the browser and
**previewing a stream in your browser requires a video player**.

For instructions and information about this, access the
[Playback](/guides/playback-a-video-stream) guide.

This guide provides information on configuring your broadcasting software:

- Ways to get the `streamKey`
- Using the `RTMP URL`

- Setting the keyframe intervals

## About Broadcasting Configuration

Understanding how to configure the broadcasting software being used so that you
able to push an RTMP stream into Livepeer Studio. In order to broadcast a live
stream, you’ll need a stream key.

## What You Can Build Here

| Implementation                          | Description                                                                                         |

| Set up broadcast software configuration | Configuring the settings of the broadcasting software using the `RTMP URL` long with the stream key |
| Set up keyframe intervals               | Adjusting the keyframe levels for optimizing the stream                                             |

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for
developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer Studio account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](/category/api)

## Ways to Find Your Stream Key:

There are two ways to find the stream key:

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard(no code)

## Get the stream key using the API

### Getting the stream key from creating a stream

### Request

When you create a `stream` object with a `POST` request to `/api/stream`

> **Note:** The value of the `streamKey` in the response.

### Response

```json
{
  "lastSeen": 0,
  "isActive": false,
  "record": false,
  "suspended": false,
  "sourceSegments": 0,
  "transcodedSegments": 0,
  "sourceSegmentsDuration": 0,
  "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 0,
  "sourceBytes": 0,
  "transcodedBytes": 0,

  }
}
```

### Getting the stream key from a stream

### Request

Make a `GET` request to `/api/stream/[id]`

> **Note** The value of the`streamKey` in the response.

### Reponse

```json
  {
      "name":"test_stream",
      "profiles":[
          {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
          {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480},
          {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360},
        ],
      "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
      "createdAt":1596081229373,
      "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
      "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
      {other asset object keys}
  }
```

## Get the stream key with Livepeer Studio Dashboard

- Login to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard, navigate to the
  [streams list page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams), and click on a
  stream name. Reveal and copy your secret stream key.

When configuring broadcast software to push streams, use the secret `streamKey`
and the Livepeer Studio RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live`.

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, you’ll be prompted for
the following:

- Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your Livepeer
  Studio `streamKey` not the name of your stream.
- Server URL: Input the RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live`.
- Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the `streamKey` appended. For
  example, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/[streamKey]`.

## Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer Studio works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2
seconds.

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting
software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to
"Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced"
and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
