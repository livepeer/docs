# Quickstart

Learn how to create an API key and start building!

## Get Started

### Step 1: Create an API key in Livepeer Studio

First, go to [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard). Click `Create API Key`. A dialogue should appear.

In the dialogue field, enter a name for your API key.

<Callout>
  The API key name is only used on the frontend for tracking purposes - we
  recommend adding useful detail like the intended scope of the API key, so it
  does not get reused across multiple applications.
</Callout>

### Step 2 (optional): Enable CORS

If you are developing a frontend application and want to get started quickly
with the API, you can create an API key with CORS access enabled. API keys
created with this option can be used from the browser from any origin for which
it is configured.

### Step 3: Using the API Key

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request
with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}
```

With this, you're ready to start building!
