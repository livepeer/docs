# Quickstart

Learn how to create an API key and start building!

## Get Started

<Steps>

### Create an API key in Livepeer Studio

First, go to [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard). Click `Create API Key`. A dialogue should appear.

![Quickstart 1](/images/quickstart/create-an-api-key.png)

In the dialogue field, enter a name for your API key.

<Callout>
  The API key name is only used on the frontend for tracking purposes - we
  recommend adding useful detail like the intended scope of the API key, so it
  does not get reused across multiple applications.
</Callout>

### Using the API Key

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request
with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}
```

With this, you're ready to start building!

### Enable CORS (optional)

By default, API keys can only be used from a backend server. This is to ensure
maximum security and prevent that you accidentally expose your account by
including the secret API key in some public web page.

However, if you are developing a frontend application and want to get started
quickly with the Livepeer API, you can also create an API key with CORS access
enabled. API keys created with that option can be used from the browser, from
any origin that you configure it for.

> Note: An origin is just a combination of a scheme, like `https`, with a domain like `example.com`. You will also need to include the port number if you are using a non-standard port.(e.g.`http://localhost:8080` when developing locally on port 8080 or `https://my.app.io` after deploying it on a public domain).

To enable CORS, simply tick the `Allow CORS access` checkbox when creating your
API key. You will then be prompted to add all the origins that you would like
the API key to be used from:

We recommend that you add the minimal list of origins to your API key. Ideally
also creating separate API keys to be used for development or production. At
your own discretion, you can use the same API key for all your environments and
allow all the origins for it. You can also just add the `*` special value to
allow the key to be used from any origin.

> Note: CORS is only a client-side check that browsers make and sometimes does
> not prevent the API from being called. It also does not prevent the API key
> from being used from other places like a backend or a custom client.

#### API access

For an additional layer of security, we also limit the access of the
CORS-enabled keys to the API.

CORS-enabled API keys have restricted access to the API by default. This means
that they are only allowed to call some specific endpoints of the API.

This is another intermediate security measure, so that even if a malicious actor
snoops the API key from your web page they still won't be able access the most
sensitive data in your account. For example, APIs that expose PIIs, payment
information or list API resources created by other users are disallowed.

#### Full API access

If your application needs further access to the API, it is strongly recommended
that you run a backend to secure an API key and call the API privately. From it
you can also perform any custom authentication with your frontend and validate
the API calls to protect your Livepeer Studio account. Check the
[livepeer-web-api-proxy](https://github.com/victorges/livepeer-web-api-proxy)
for a sample project with such a backend.

If you are aware of the implications but still want to create an API key with
full access to your account, you can do so by ticking the `Full API access`
checkbox when creating your API key.

An API key with `Full API access` will be able to access and manage every
information in your account, including:

- All your contact info provided on registration
- Change your billing plan
- List and delete all the streams and assets stored in your account.
