# Explore Viewer Engagement

Livepeer offers detailed information on viewer behavior and playback quality on your platform. The API includes engagement metrics such as view counts and watch time, as well as performance metrics such as error rate, time to first frame, rebuffer ratio, and exit-before-starts across a variety of dimensions.

### Usage Metrics

This API also includes usage metrics to help you understand how viewers are engaging with your platform:

- Number of Views: This metric gives you a comprehensive view of the total number of views across your platform. We colloquially define a view as “play intent”, which means the video either played, stalled, or encountered an error.
- Hours of Watch Time: Measure the total amount of time viewers spend on your platform, so you can track engagement and identify areas for improvement.

### Performance Metrics

This API offers several key performance metrics to help you understand your platforms performance:

- Error Rate: Percentage of views that encountered an error.
- Time to First Frame (TTFF): Measures the time in milliseconds it takes between the player requesting video and the first frame being ready to play.
- Rebuffer Ratio: Percentage of time a viewer spends experiencing rebuffering during playback.
- Exit Before Starts: Percentage of views that are abandoned before the video begins to play, potentially indicating issues with playback.

### Dimensions

To provide a comprehensive view of viewer behavior, our data product includes several dimensions to help you segment your data and identify patterns:

- Video: View metrics for individual videos, queryable by playbackId or by dStorage Id’s such as CID.
- Browser: Understand how different browsers impact viewer behavior and performance, so you can optimize your platform for each browser type.
- Device: Understand how different devices impact viewer behavior, so you can optimize your platform for each device type.
- OS: Understand how different operating systems impact viewer behavior, so you can optimize your platform for each OS.
- Continent, Country, and Subdivisions: Segment your data by location to identify regional trends and tailor your platform to local preferences.
- Time Zone: Measure viewer behavior across different time zones, so you can optimize your platform for peak usage times.
- Time: Analyze viewer behavior across different time periods (hour, day, week, month, year, all-time) to identify trends.

  Notes:

- Data is refreshed every 5 minutes
- Newly uploaded videos may take up to an hour before viewership data is available

## Using the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

The Livepeer Studio Dashboard is a frontend interface for publishing live or
on-demand video streams with no code. In this guide, we'll show you how to use
the dashboard to retrieve viewership metrics.

### Step 1: Navigate to the [Assets page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/assets)

![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-1.png)

### Step 2: Click on an existing asset

Click on an existing asset and you'll be brought to that asset's specific
details page. If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/developing/upload-a-video-asset).

![Assets page](/images/engagement/Dashboard-4.png)

### Step 3: View your asset's viewership metrics

In the asset's specific detail page you can view its total number of views.

<Callout>
  The viewership API is still in development. Currently, viewer count metrics
  are only available for on demand assets. The count registers start views with
  deduping logic that prevents users from attempting to inflate view counts. In
  the future, we'll support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you
  can better understand popularity and performance.

## Using the Livepeer Player

### Step 1: Register viewership metrics

To collect and register viewership metrics, you first need to configure your player.
We recommend that you use the [Livepeer player](/reference/livepeer-js/Player)
to get viewership metrics, as it comes fully configured.
You can follow the Player guide to get started.

### Step 2: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/developing/view-asset).

### Step 3: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.

<Tabs items={['JavaScript', 'cURL']}>
  <Tab>

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total',
  {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
);

const { startViews } = (await response.json())[0];
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```bash
curl --location --request GET https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using a Custom Player

### Step 1: Register viewership metrics

We also support viewership metrics for applications using custom players.
In order for metrics to be tracked by Livepeer, you will need to configure
your player using `addMediaMetrics`.

Here's how to configure your player:

<Tabs items={['JavaScript', 'React']}>
  <Tab>

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer/media/browser';

const source =
  'https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8';
const video = document.getElementById('my-video');

// set up your player before calling addMediaMetrics

addMediaMetrics(video, source, (e) => console.error('Error adding metrics', e));
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer/media/browser';
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [source, setSource] = useState(
    'https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8',
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      // set up other stuff in your player before calling addMediaMetrics
      const metrics = addMediaMetrics(videoRef.current, source, (e) =>
        console.error('Error adding metrics', e),
      );
      return metrics?.destroy;
    }
  }, [videoRef, source]);

  return (
    <video
      controls
      ref={videoRef}
      src={source}
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px' }}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs items={['JavaScript', 'React']}>
  <Tab>

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer/media/browser';

const source =
  'https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8';
const video = document.getElementById('my-video');

// setup your player before calling addMediaMetrics

addMediaMetrics(video, source, (e) => console.error('Error adding metrics', e));
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer/media/browser';
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [source, setSource] = useState(
    'https://livepeercdn.studio/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8',
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      // set up other stuff in your player before calling addMediaMetrics
      const metrics = addMediaMetrics(videoRef.current, source, (e) =>
        console.error('Error adding metrics', e),
      );
      return metrics?.destroy;
    }
  }, [videoRef, source]);

  return (
    <video
      controls
      ref={videoRef}
      src={source}
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px' }}
    />
  );
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the upload a video asset guide.

### Step 3: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.

<Tabs items={['JavaScript', 'cURL']}>

    },
  },
);

const { startViews } = (await response.json())[0];
```

  </Tab>
