The Livepeer Studio Dashboard is a frontend interface for publishing live or
on-demand video streams with no code. In this guide, we'll show you how to use
the dashboard to retrieve viewership metrics.

## Step 1: Navigate to the [Assets page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/assets)

![Assets page](/../static/guides/Dashboard-1.png)

## Step 2: Click on an existing asset

Click on an existing asset and you'll be brought to that asset's specific
details page. If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#dashboard) to
do so.

## Step 3: View your asset's viewership metrics

In the asset's specific detail page you can view its total number of views.

:::note

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, viewer count metrics are
only available for on demand assets. The count registers start views with
deduping logic that prevents users from attempting to inflate view counts. In
the future, we'll support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you
can better understand popularity and performance.

[Let us know](https://livepeer.studio/contact) if you have any particular
feature requests related to metrics.

## Using Livepeer Player

### Step 1: Register viewership metrics

To collect and register viewership metrics, you first need to configure your player.
We recommend that you use the [Livepeer player](https://livepeerjs.org/react/Player)
to get viewership metrics, as it comes fully configured.
You can follow [this guide](/guides/playback-a-video-stream) to set it up.

### Step 2: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#api) to do so.

### Step 3: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total',
  {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
);

const { startViews } = (await response.json())[0];
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request GET https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Using Custom Player

### Step 1: Register viewership metrics

We also support viewership metrics for applications using custom players.
In order for metrics to be tracked by Livepeer, you will need to configure
your player using `addMediaMetrics`.

Here's how to configure your player:

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer';

const source =
  'https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8';
const video = document.getElementById('my-video');

// setup your player before calling addMediaMetrics

addMediaMetrics(video, source, (e) => console.error('Error adding metrics', e));
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="React" label="React">

```js
import { addMediaMetrics } from 'livepeer';
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [source, setSource] = useState(
    'https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/bd600224-d93a-4ddc-a6ac-2d71e3c36768/index.m3u8',
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      // set up other stuff in your player before calling addMediaMetrics
      const metrics = addMediaMetrics(videoRef.current, source, (e) =>
        console.error('Error adding metrics', e),
      );
      return metrics?.destroy;
    }
  }, [videoRef, source]);

  return (
    <video
      controls
      ref={videoRef}
      src={source}
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px' }}
    />
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Step 2: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#api) to do so.

### Step 3: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total',
  {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
);

const { startViews } = (await response.json())[0];
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request GET https://livepeer.studio/api/data/views/{assetId}/total \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```
