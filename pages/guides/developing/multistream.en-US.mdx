<Callout>
  Multistreaming is a Beta feature, and you may experience occasional instability while using it. We are actively working to improve this feature and plan to move it out of Beta in the near future.

# Multistream

Multistream allows a source stream and transcoded renditions to be pushed to
multiple RTMP(S) targets, such as Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube
Live.

<Callout>
  See the [reference docs](/reference/api) for more information on the API.

## Manage Multistream targets in the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

To add, manage, and delete `Multistream Targets`, navigate to the [Streams page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams)
and click on a stream name. On the stream detail page, on the `Overview` tab,
you can view all configured targets. You must configure new
`Multistream Targets` for each stream. This will apply the multistream
configuration to that stream. `Multistream Targets` do not carry over when you
create new streams.

To add a new target, select `Create` on the right side of the
`Multistream Targets` section. You'll be asked to name your target, provide the
Ingest URL and a stream key, being Ingest URL the only required value. The
Ingest URL and stream key should be provided by the platform that you're
streaming into and can be of the RTMP, RTMPS or SRT protocols. Select the
rendition profile that you'd like to send to that target and click
`Create Target`. Once created, you can toggle the targets on and off.

To edit a `Multistream Target`, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on `Edit` to open up the target settings. Select
`Update target` when you've completed your changes.

To delete a multistream target, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on `Delete`.

> **Note:** Any changes to <code>Multistream Targets</code>, including creating
> new targets, will apply only to the next active session. If you make changes
> while a stream is active, those changes will not apply until the current
> session has ended and a new session begins.

## Managing Multistream targets with the API

### About Multistream Target Objects

You can also manage `Multistream Target` objects, `/multistream/target`, from
the API. Each target represents a specific endpoint where a stream could be
multistreamed to. See details in the [API reference](/reference/api).

Notice that the existence of a `Multistream Target` object itself is not enough
for the multistream to happen. You also need to reference the target from the
`Stream` object that should be multistreamed. To avoid managing the separate
`Multistream Target` objects, you can also create the targets inlined in the
`Stream` creation and update APIs.

## Understanding Multistream Performance

### Dashboard

While a session is active that has multistream targets configured, you'll be
able to see if a destination is "Active" or "Offline". **_NOTE:_** There may be
a slight delay between starting the stream and the push destinations connecting.
When starting to stream to multistream targets, use these indicators to
understand whether it has connected to its target(s).

On the stream page where you've configured your multistream targets, select the
"Health" tab at the top. While a session is active, you'll see the ingest rate
of the source stream.

### Webhooks

We have 3 webhooks to help you monitor the state of your `Multistream Targets`:

- `multistream.connected`: When we have successfully connected to the
  `Multistream Target` and you're also online in the other service you are
  multistreaming to.
- `multistream.error`: In case any error has occurred during connection to the
  `Multistream Target`. This means some kind of problem with the configuration
  or the other service you are multistreaming to.
- `multistream.disconnected`: Sent after a stream is ended to indicate that
  Multistream has also ended for the respective target.
