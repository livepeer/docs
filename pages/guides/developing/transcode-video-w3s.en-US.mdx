title: Transcode Video with Web3 Storage

<Callout type="warning">
    The playback of long videos (longer than 1h) stored in Web3 Storage can be slow due to the W3 Link issue tracked [here](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3link/issues/46). 
</Callout>

## Introduction

This guide will describe how to use the Livepeer [transcode API](/reference/api/transcode-video) to transcode and store video files in [web3.storage](http://web3.storage).

There are [code examples](#code-examples) provided for reference.

## UCAN Proof

This step assumes that you have [w3 CLI](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3cli) installed. Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3cli#getting-started) instructions to create new space for storing data and register the space.

Get Livepeer Studio DID.

```json
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/did
```

The response should contain the Livepeer Studio DID.

```json
{
  "did": "did:key:z6Mkn1f6JUmxJi8Ht53SzeK3LSWNn9DRPsSfFLoPJWHVTCaX"
}
```

Create a UCAN delegation.

```json
w3 delegation create <livepeer-studio-did-key> | base64
```

This returns the base64-encoded delegation proof which authorizes the Livepeer Studio DID to store data to your space. Note that the proof should not contain any whitespaces.

## Upload Video to web3.storage

Make sure you have a video file uploaded to web3.storage. You can do upload a file using the `w3 up` command by following [these instructions](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3cli#w3-up-path-path).

## Transcode with Livepeer

This step assumes that you have already created a [Livepeer Studio account](https://livepeer.studio/) and an [API key](https://docs.livepeer.org/guides/developing/quickstart).

Submit the following request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/transcode' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
   "input":{
      "url":"$INPUT_VIDEO_URL"
   },
   "storage":{
      "type":"web3.storage",
      "credentials":{
         "proof":"$DELEGATION_PROOF"
      }
   },
   "outputs":{
      "hls":{
         "path":"/"
      },
      "mp4":{
         "path":"/"
      }
   },
   "profiles":[
      {
         "name":"480p",
         "bitrate":1000000,
         "fps":30,
         "width":854,
         "height":480
      },
      {
         "name":"360p",
         "bitrate":500000,
         "fps":30,
         "width":640,
         "height":360
      }
   ]
}'
```

- `$API_KEY` should be your Livepeer Studio API key
- `$DELEGATION_PROOF` should be the delegation proof you created using `w3`
- `input.url` should be the URL of the video you would like to transcode
- `outputs.hls.path` will be the relative path that the HLS playlist and mpegts segments will be found in when transcoding is complete
- `outputs.mp4.path` will be the path that the MP4 video files will be found in when transcoding is complete
- `profiles` is an optional parameter to specify the desired properties of transcoded video

Use the task ID in the response to query for the transcoding task status. Once the task is complete, youâ€™ll see the output directory IPFS URL in the `/api/task` response in the `output.transcodeFile.baseUrl` field.

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "type": "transcode-file",
  "output": {
    "transcodeFile": {
      "baseUrl": "ipfs://bafybeiakkypfc7uzk6jnk6pg3f2fwumkahrmgbii7cigyyc7oejjo3ff4e",
      "hls": {
        "path": "/index.m3u8"
       },
      "mp4": [
            { "path": "/static360p0.mp4" },
            { "path": "/static720p0.mp4" },
            { "path": "/static1080p0.mp4" }
      ]
     }
   },
  ...
}
```
