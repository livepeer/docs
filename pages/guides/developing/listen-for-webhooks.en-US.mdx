# Listen for Webhooks

The following includes information and instructions on how to work with webhooks
to communicate with your application:

- Use webhooks to listen for video lifecycle events
- Check webhook signatures to ensure incoming webhook requests are coming from
  Livepeer

## **About Webhooks**

Livepeer Studio uses webhooks to communicate with your application
asynchronously when events for your stream occur. For example, you may want to
know when a stream has become `active` or `idle`, so that you can surface this
information to viewers. When these events happen, you can make a `POST` request
to a URL that you specify.

## Types of Events

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stream.started`           | The parent stream object's isActive value is marked as true and the .m3u8 HLS URL works                                                                                |
| `stream.idle`              | The parent stream object's isActive value should be marked as false and the .m3u8 HLS URL no longer works                                                              |

| `playback.accessControl`   | A specialized webhook for playback access control. Unlike other events, this is only used for assets and streams that reference its ID on their playback policy.       |

## Configuring Webhook Endpoints

Webhook endpoints are specific for each `event`. Once the event is registered,
all streams for this account will be triggering the specific event.

**For Example:** Registering for `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events:

### Request

This cURL request registers a `stream.started` and `stream.idle` event so that
all streams will trigger the `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events for this
account.

```bash
curl \
    -X POST \
    -H "authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    --data-raw '{
      "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
      "url": "{webhook_url}",
      "name": "test webhooks"
  }' \
  https://livepeer.studio/api/webhook
```

### Response

Returns a JSON object with the webhook object just created. This includes its `id`, `name`, the `events` it will be notified about and
the `url` that will be called.

```json
{
  "createdAt": 1624939859628,
  "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
  "id": "e7b8a281-8952-4791-b837-183cb95bbf32",
  "kind": "webhook",
  "name": "test webhooks",
  "url": "{webhook_endpoint}",
  "userId": "ffcd3b74-9908-4d23-be05-58e1480e752a"
}
```

## Retries

Currently, if a webhook fails, Livepeer will attempt to deliver the webhook for
~15 minutes with an exponential back-off.

## Other Webhooks Endpoints

`GET /api/webhook`: Get a list of webhooks

`GET /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Get a single webhook Object details

`PUT /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Edit a webhook, using the same parameters as POST
/webhook

`DEL /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Delete a webhook

## Webhook Signatures

You can verify webhook requests that Livepeer Studio sends to your endpoints,
using the request header signature included by Livepeer Studio. This signature
will help you verify the incoming request comes from Livepeer Studio and not a
third party.

- Livepeer Studio will include a signature in each eventâ€™s `Livepeer-Signature`
  header.

- The timestamp is prefixed by `t=` and the signature is prefixed by a scheme.

- Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only valid
  signature scheme is v1. Livepeer Studio generates signatures using HMAC with
  SHA2-256.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
Livepeer-Signature: t=36285904404,v1=88f3ff0fds9sf8a98vb0b096e81507cfd5c932fc17cf63a4a55566fd38da3a2d3d2
```

## Validate the signature, take the following steps:

### Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header

1. Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of
   elements.

2. Split each element, using the `=` character as the separator, to get a prefix
   and value pair.

- The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and
- `v1` corresponds to the signature (or signatures). You can discard all other
  elements.

### Prepare the signed_payload string

The `signed_payload` is the raw request payload.

It is important to **Note:** that the `JSON` in the request payload includes the
same `timestamp` from the signature header to protect against replay attacks.

### Determine the expected signature

Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature.

- **For an equality match** compute the difference between the current timestamp
  and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your
  tolerance.

- **To protect against timing attacks:** use a constant-time string comparison
  to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.
