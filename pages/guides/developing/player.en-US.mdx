# Add a Player

We demonstrate below how to use either the Livepeer.JS React Player, Video.JS, or
our embeddable iFrame player.

## Using livepeer.js with React

The example below shows our drop-in player for easily viewing media content! The example below uses the
[`Player`](/reference/livepeer-js/Player) to view a video asset, with some custom styles to demonstrate what's possible with
the player.

<br />

<DemoPlayer />

### Step 1: Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with the Studio provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/reference/livepeer-js/providers/studio#apikey),
as well as a theme to use for all livepeer.js React components.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  ThemeConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

const theme: ThemeConfig = {
  colors: {
    accent: 'rgb(0, 145, 255)',
    containerBorderColor: 'rgba(0, 145, 255, 0.9)',
  },
  fonts: {
    display: 'Inter',
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient} theme={theme}>
      <CreateAndViewAsset />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Play Video

Now that our providers are set up, we use the [`Player`](/reference/livepeer-js/Player) with an IPFS CID as our `playbackId`, which we created
previously when uploading a video asset and [storing to IPFS](/reference/livepeer-js/asset/useUpdateAsset). We use
[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) as our optimized poster image, but this could also
be a simple image URL.

We also override some of the custom styling to match the flow of our app!

```tsx filename="DemoPlayer.tsx"
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

import Image from 'next/image';

const playbackId =
  'bafybeida3w2w7fch2fy6rfvfttqamlcyxgd3ddbf4u25n7fxzvyvcaegxy';

import blenderPoster from '../../public/images/blender-poster.png';

const PosterImage = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={blenderPoster}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

export const DemoPlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Waterfalls"
      playbackId={playbackId}
      showPipButton
      showTitle={false}
      aspectRatio="16to9"
      poster={<PosterImage />}
      controls={{
        autohide: 3000,
      }}
      theme={{
        borderStyles: { containerBorderStyle: 'hidden' },
        radii: { containerBorderRadius: '10px' },
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## Using your own player

Using livepeer.js is the recommended way to play back a video or a
live stream - it handles errors from the API correctly and is a true web3-native media player.
However, if you want to use an alternative, you can do so by
following the instructions below.

<Callout>
  Please note that to play back live streams inside your application you'll need
  to use a video player component that supports HLS.
</Callout>

### Create a playback URL

To playback a live stream in other players, you'll need to create an HLS URL.
HLS is a protocol that allows you to stream video and audio content over HTTP.
Most of the video you watch on the web is delivered using HLS. Livepeer also
uses HLS to deliver video and audio content.

<Callout type="warning">
  Playback URLs are different for live streams and on-demand videos. Please make
  sure you're using the correct URL for the type of content you're trying to
  playback.
</Callout>

You can create an HLS url by using the below format and replacing the
`PLAYBACK_ID` with your stream's `playbackId`.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/index.m3u8
```

On-demand videos have a different format for the playback URLs. To play back these
videos, you can use the below format and replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your
video's playback id.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/asset/{PLAYBACK_ID}/video
```

### Use the playback URL in a player

You can use the playback URL with any video player that supports HLS. Here is a
list of popular players that support HLS:

- [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)
- [Plyr.io](https://plyr.io/)
- [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/html5-video-player/)
- [Bitmovin Player](https://bitmovin.com/video-player/)
- [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) (requires custom logic to wire to a video element)

Here is an example of how to use the playback URL in video.js player.

```html
<head>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" />

  <!-- If you'd like to support IE8 (for Video.js versions prior to v7) -->
  <!-- <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/ie8/1.1.2/videojs-ie8.min.js"></script> -->
</head>

<body>
  <video
    id="my-video"
    class="video-js"
    controls
    preload="auto"
    width="640"
    height="264"
    poster="MY_VIDEO_POSTER.jpg"
  >
    <source
      src="https://livepeercdn.com/asset/${PLAYBACK_ID}/video"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>

  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

<VideoJSPlayer />

## Using the embeddable player

<Callout type="warning">
  The embeddable player is currently in beta and some elements may change as we
  mature the product. For a production-grade application consider using
  Livepeer.js instead.
</Callout>

This is one of the easiest way to play back a video on your website/applications.
You can embed the player on your website/applications by using the below code
snippet.

You can replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your video's playback id.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv?v={PLAYBACK_ID}"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
  sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
>
</iframe>
```

<IframePlayer />

import { prefetchPlayerStaticProps } from '@lib/prefetchStaticProps';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  return prefetchPlayerStaticProps(
    'bafybeida3w2w7fch2fy6rfvfttqamlcyxgd3ddbf4u25n7fxzvyvcaegxy',
  );
};
