# Stream from the Browser

We demonstrate below how to broadcast from the web using Livepeer's low latency WebRTC broadcast.

## Using the Livepeer.js Broadcast

The example below show to use the Livepeer.js [`Broadcast`](/reference/livepeer-js/Broadcast) to broadcast from the web.

<Steps>

### Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with a gateway provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/reference/livepeer-js/providers/studio#apikey),
as well as a theme to use for all livepeer.js React components.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient}>
      <CreateAndViewAsset />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

### Broadcast

Now that our providers are set up, we use the [`Broadcast`](/reference/livepeer-js/Broadcast) with a stream key, from a stream we created.
We also override some of the custom styling to match the flow of our app!

```tsx filename="DemoBroadcast.tsx"
import { Broadcast } from '@livepeer/react';

const streamKey = 'your-stream-key';

export const DemoBroadcast = () => {
  return (
    <Broadcast
      streamKey={streamKey}
      controls={{
        autohide: 3000,
      }}
      theme={{
        borderStyles: { containerBorderStyle: 'hidden' },
        radii: { containerBorderRadius: '10px' },
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

</Steps>

## Embeddable Broadcast

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The embeddable broadcast is currently in beta and some elements may change as
  we mature the product. For a production-grade application consider using
  Livepeer.js instead.
</Callout>

This is one of the easiest way to broadcast video from your website/applications.
You can embed the iframe on your website/applications by using the below code
snippet.

You can replace the `STREAM_KEY` with your stream key for the stream.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv/broadcast/{STREAM_KEY}"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
  sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
>
</iframe>
```

This will automatically stream from the browser, using the STUN/TURN servers to ensure that network connectivity issues
are rare.

## Adding broadcasting with plain WebRTC

Using livepeer.js is the recommended way to add easy broadcasting via WebRTC. If you want to add broadcasting to your app
and handle the WebRTC negotiation, you can follow the steps below.

<Steps>

### Get the SDP Host

First, you will need to make a request to get the proper ingest URL for the region which your end user is in. We have a global
presence, and we handle redirects based on GeoDNS to allow users to get the lowest latency server.

To do this,

```bash
curl -L 'https://webrtc.livepeer.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}'
...
> Host: lax-prod-catalyst-2.lp-playback.studio
```

You may safely ignore any errors returned from the GET request - we are only interested in getting the redirect URL from the final response,
so that we can set up the correct ICE servers.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The process will change in the future to remove the need for this extraneous
  GET request - please check back later.
</Callout>

### Broadcast

Now that we have the endpoint for the ICE servers, we can start SDP negotiation following the [WHIP spec](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-01.html)
and kick off a livestream. First, form an SDP offer with your library of choice. Make sure you specify the ICE servers, so that connectivity issues are not an issue.

```tsx
const iceServers = [
  {
    urls: `stun:${host}`,
  },
  {
    urls: `turn:${host}`,
    username: 'livepeer',
    credential: 'livepeer',
  },
];

const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({ iceServers });
```

Then send it to the host you received in the previous step (adding the path shown below).

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/sdp' \
  --data-binary @payload.sdp \
  'https://lax-prod-catalyst-2.lp-playback.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}'
```

The server will respond with an SDP response that you can then use to set up your WebRTC broadcast!
