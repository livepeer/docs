# Stream from the Browser

We demonstrate below how to broadcast from the web using Livepeer's low latency WebRTC broadcast.

## Using Livepeer.js Broadcast

The example below show to use Livepeer.js [`Broadcast`](/reference/livepeer-js/Broadcast) to broadcast from the web.

<Steps>

### Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with a gateway provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/reference/livepeer-js/providers/studio#apikey),
as well as a theme to use for all livepeer.js React components.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient}>
      <CreateAndViewAsset />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

### Broadcast

Now that our providers are set up, we use the [`Broadcast`](/reference/livepeer-js/Broadcast) with a stream key, from a stream we created.
We also override some of the custom styling to match the flow of our app!

```tsx filename="DemoBroadcast.tsx"
import { Broadcast } from '@livepeer/react';

const streamKey = 'your-stream-key';

export const DemoBroadcast = () => {
  return (
    <Broadcast
      streamKey={streamKey}
      controls={{
        autohide: 3000,
      }}
      theme={{
        borderStyles: { containerBorderStyle: 'hidden' },
        radii: { containerBorderRadius: '10px' },
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

</Steps>

## Embeddable Broadcast

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The embeddable broadcast is currently in beta and some elements may change as
  we mature the product. For a production-grade application consider using
  Livepeer.js instead.
</Callout>

This is one of the easiest way to broadcast video from your website/applications.
You can embed the iframe on your website/applications by using the below code
snippet.

You can replace the `STREAM_KEY` with your stream key for the stream.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv/broadcast/{STREAM_KEY}"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
  sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
>
</iframe>
```

This will automatically stream from the browser, using the STUN/TURN servers to ensure that network connectivity issues
are rare.

## Adding broadcasting with plain WebRTC

Using livepeer.js is the recommended way to add easy broadcasting via WebRTC. If you want to add broadcasting to your app
and handle the WebRTC negotiation, you can follow the steps below.

<Steps>

### Get the SDP Host

First, you will need to make a request to get the proper ingest URL for the region which your end user is in. We have a global
presence, and we handle redirects based on GeoDNS to allow users to get the lowest latency server.

To do this make a GET request to the WebRTC redirect endpoint:

```bash
curl -L 'https://livepeer.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}'
...
> Location: https://lax-prod-catalyst-2.lp-playback.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}
```

You may safely ignore any errors returned from the GET request - we are only interested in getting the redirect URL from the final response,
so that we can set up the correct ICE servers.

We know from the above response headers that the WebRTC ingest URL is `https://lax-prod-catalyst-2.lp-playback.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}`.
We will use this in the next step.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The process will change in the future to remove the need for this extraneous
  GET request - please check back later.
</Callout>

### Broadcast

Now that we have the endpoint for the ICE servers, we can start SDP negotiation following the [WHIP spec](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-01.html)
and kick off a livestream.

The outline of the steps are:

1. Create a new `RTCPeerConnection` with the ICE servers from the redirect URL.
2. Construct an SDP offer using the library of your choice.
3. Wait for ICE gathering.
4. Send the SDP offer to the server and get the response.
5. Use the response to set the remote description on the `RTCPeerConnection`.
6. Get a local media stream and add the track to the peer connection, and set the video element `src` to the `srcObject`.

```tsx
// the redirect URL from the above GET request
const redirectUrl = `https://lax-prod-catalyst-2.lp-playback.studio/webrtc/{STREAM_KEY}`;
// we use the host from the redirect URL in the ICE server configuration
const host = new URL(redirectUrl).host;

const iceServers = [
  {
    urls: `stun:${host}`,
  },
  {
    urls: `turn:${host}`,
    username: 'livepeer',
    credential: 'livepeer',
  },
];

const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({ iceServers });

/**
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createOffer
 * We create an SDP offer here which will be shared with the server
 */
const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();
/** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription */
await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);

/** Wait for ICE gathering to complete */
const ofr = await new Promise<RTCSessionDescription | null>((resolve) => {
  /** Wait at most five seconds for ICE gathering. */
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(peerConnection.localDescription);
  }, 5000);
  peerConnection.onicegatheringstatechange = (_ev) => {
    if (peerConnection.iceGatheringState === 'complete') {
      resolve(peerConnection.localDescription);
    }
  };
});
if (!ofr) {
  throw Error('failed to gather ICE candidates for offer');
}
/**
 * This response contains the server's SDP offer.
 * This specifies how the client should communicate,
 * and what kind of media client and server have negotiated to exchange.
 */
const sdpResponse = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: 'POST',
  mode: 'cors',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/sdp',
  },
  body: ofr.sdp,
});
if (sdpResponse.ok) {
  const answerSDP = await sdpResponse.text();
  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(
    new RTCSessionDescription({ type: 'answer', sdp: answerSDP }),
  );
}

// get user media from the browser (which are camera/audio sources)
const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: true,
  audio: true,
});
// add the tracks to the peer connection
for (const track of mediaStream.getTracks()) {
  peerConnection.addTrack(track);
}
// set the media stream on the video element
element.srcObject = mediaStream;
```

We just negotiated following the WHIP spec (which outlines the structure for the POST requests seen above)
and we did SDP negotiation to create a new livestream. We then retrieved a local webcam source and started
a broadcast!

### Clean Up

After the user is done broadcasting, you _must_ signal to our WebRTC ingest server that the stream is completed.
To do this, make a `DELETE` request to the `Location` header returned in the SDP response.

```tsx
const cleanupPath = sdpResponse.headers.get('Location'); // looks something like videorec+8600amnqv1443osc/332905

await fetch(`https://${host}/${cleanupPath}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  mode: 'cors',
});
```

This must be done every time a user completes a broadcast. This is also outlined in more detail in the WHIP spec.

To make the above process clearer, here is the flow (credit to the authors of the WHIP spec):
