# Install `Go Livepeer`

Depending on your workflow, you may prefer to install `Go livepeer`
[using a binary release](/guides/orchestrating/install-go-livepeer#install-using-a-binary-release) or
a [Docker image](/guides/orchestrating/install-go-livepeer#install-using-a-docker-image).

## Install using a Binary Release

### Recommended

Use the `install.sh` script from the [`go-livepeer` repository](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/install.sh) to get a completely
automated latest release installed onto your system. The script
requires presence of `curl`, `sha256sum` (for checksum verification)
and `gpg` (for signature validation). To install required dependencies
please use the following commands (for popular ubuntu/mac systems):

#### Dependencies

```bash
# For ubuntu
# apt install curl coreutils gnupg2

# For macOS
# brew install curl coreutils gnupg
```

#### Installation

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/master/install.sh)"
```

Additional steps to install custom release for individual OS are declared below.

### Darwin (macOS)

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.29
# IMPORTANT: if you are using macOS with an M1 chip, you'll need to run these commands using the Rosetta emulator

# Fetch the latest release
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

# Next, extract it
tar -zxvf livepeer-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory
mv livepeer-darwin-amd64/* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.29

# Fetch the latest release
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Next, extract it
tar -zxvf livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory
mv livepeer-linux-amd64/* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

```shell
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version, e.g. v0.5.29

# Fetch the latest release .zip
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

# Next, extract it
unzip livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

# Finally, move it to the appropriate directory, e.g. C:\Users\UserName\livepeer-folder
move livepeer-windows-amd64 e.g. C:\Users\UserName\livepeer-folder
```

> **Note** At this time Livepeer does not provide automatic
> updates. You can perform a manual update or use a script. **A

### Third-party packages

Packages for different Linux distributions are maintained by Livepeer
community members. Before using these packages, please verify that
they have been updated to use the [latest builds of
go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases). This
list will be updated as a best-effort, but we cannot guarantee if
individual packages are up to date or verify their integrity.

In the future, Livepeer core contributors may publish official
packages for the distributions below.

#### Arch Linux

**Source**

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-livepeer-bin/

**Installation**

```
paru go-livepeer-bin
```

## Install using a Docker image

### Prerequisites

If you do not have Docker installed, you will need to install it using the guide
[here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before running the commands below.

### Installation

With every release, Docker images are pushed to
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/livepeer/go-livepeer).

If you are running macOS with an M1 chip, you'll need to [run your terminal using the Rosetta emulator](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/428769) and specifically pull the `linux/amd64` release. In the future, we will provide alternative `arm64` builds.

```bash
# <RELEASE_VERSION> is the release version i.e. 0.5.14
docker pull livepeer/go-livepeer:<RELEASE_VERSION>

# Mac M1 only
# docker pull --platform linux/amd64 livepeer/go-livepeer:<RELEASE_VERSION>
```

### Running livepeer-cli with Docker

Once you've pulled the image, retrieve the image id and start the container.

**Any flags you provide will be passed to the binary**, so you can pass [your configuration](/installation/configuring-livepeer) here.

```bash
docker run <image id> <livepeer configuration flags>

# Mac M1 only
# docker run --platform linux/amd64 <image id> <livepeer configuration flags>
```

Once you've started the container, retrieve the name and start the CLI

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> livepeer_cli
```
