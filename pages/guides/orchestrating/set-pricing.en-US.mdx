# Set Pricing

In this guide we'll go over how to set and configure pricing to charge for transcoding advertised to broadcasters off-chain.

## Choose a Price

To charge for transcoding orchestrators set a price per pixel denominated in Wei (1 ETH = 1e18 Wei), advertised to broadcasters off-chain.

To get support for setting a price that will allow you to receive work on the network, contact us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uaPhtyrWsF) channel.

## Configure Automatic Price Adjustments

By default, an orchestrator will automatically adjust its price based on the overhead of ticket redemption.

Configure your orchestrator to advertise a constant price:

- Start the orchestrator with the `-autoAdjustPrice=false` flag.

- Additionally, you can refer to the [Automatic Price Adjustment](/video-miners/core-concepts/payments#automatic-price-adjustments) docs for more in-depth information.

## Set a Price With `livepeer_cli`

You can set the base price per pixel using the `livepeer_cli`:

1. Run `livepeer_cli`

2. Enter the number corresponding to the `Set orchestrator config` option

3. You will get prompted to enter values for several fields.

  If you only want to set the price, you can continue using the existing default
  values.

4. You will get prompted for the price per pixel:

5. Set the number of pixels in a single unit of work you will charge for.

**For example:**

```bash
   Enter a transcoding base price in wei per pixels
   eg. 1 wei / 10 pixels = 0,1 wei per pixel
   Enter the number of pixels that make up a single unit (default: 1 pixel):
```

  The Default setting `option (1)` is typically used.
</Callout>

6. Set the price (in wei) that you will charge per unit of work:

   ```bash
   Enter the price for 1 pixel in Wei (required):
   ```

7. To verify the price was updated, check the log from your node.
