# Vote on protocol proposals

Follow the steps below to set and configure voting in governance polls with `livepeer_cli`. You can do this without exporting keys from the machine on which the orchestrator node is running.

## Voting With the `livepeer_cli`

Follow the steps herein to access and vote with the `livepeer_cli`:

1. Find the contract address for the poll in the [Livepeer Explorer](https://explorer.livepeer.org/voting) page for the poll.

   Click the link, "Follow these instructions", to display the instructions for voting with `livepeer_cli`:

2. Run `livepeer_cli`

3. Enter the number corresponding to the option to `Vote on a poll`

4. Enter the contract address saved in step 1.:

   ```bash
   Enter the contract address for the poll you want to vote on - >
   ```

   You will be prompted with the following voting options:

   ```bash
   Identifier  Voting Options
   0     Yes
   1     No
   ```

5. Choose and confirm your vote

**For example:**

```bash
Enter the ID of the option you want to vote for - > 0
Are you sure you want to vote "Yes" ? (y/n) - > y

success
```

6. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed. You should be able to view your node submitting the vote transaction.

**For example:**

```bash
I0422 03:30:44.191809   43457 backend.go:96]
******************************Eth Transaction******************************

Invoking transaction: "vote". Inputs: "_choiceID: 0"  Hash: "0xf6957c190f1f16fc2ca4a93846903eb435c5e08fa7f6f40b6e159aab6d74905f".

**************************************************************************
```

7. Once the vote transaction is confirmed, you will be able to see your vote reflected in the explorer poll page of the UI.
