# Monitor Metrics

This guide provides instructions on configuring metrics monitoring for orchestrators that have been [activated](/guides/orchestrating/get-started#activate) on the Livepeer network.

- Enable Metrics Monitoring
- Monitor with visualizations
  - Prometheus
  - Grafana
- Monitor with Docker

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can refer to [Prometheus
  Metrics](/reference/go-livepeer/prometheus-metrics) to check what metrics are
  exposed.
</Callout>

## Enabling Metrics Monitoring

You can enable metrics monitoring with `livepeer.exe` adding the `-monitor` flag and additional parameters:

- `-monitor`: enables metric monitoring
- `-metricsPerStream`: groups performance metrics per stream
- `-metricsClientIP`: exposes client's IP in metrics

**For Example:**

Enable metrics monitoring with a combined orchestrator and
transcoder:

```bash
livepeer \
    -orchestrator \
    -transcoder \
    -monitor
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For the purpose of this example, other flags have been omitted.
</Callout>

## Monitoring With Prometheus and Grafana

Follow the instructions in this
[monitoring guide](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/guide-transcoder-monitoring-with-prometheus-grafana/1225) to learn how metrics recorded by `livepeer` can be:

- Exported to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and
- Visualized in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

## Monitoring with Docker

You can use this [Docker container](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-monitoring) to easily start monitoring your orchestrator or transcoder. It bundles Prometheus, Grafana, and a few starter Grafana dashboard templates.
