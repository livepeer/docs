# Update Signing Key

`PATCH /access-control/signing-key/{KEY_ID}` updates an existing `signing key`.
It is a single endpoint that can update any of the mutable properties of a stream. Specifically:

- `name`
- `disabled`

All fields are optional, and if any field is not included in the request payload
it will be kept unchanged from the saved object.

## Request

### Disabling a signing key

This is useful when you want to rotate signing keys but don't want to risk deleting the old one permanently.
Instead you can disable it first and check that nothing broke to only then delete it permanently.

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "disabled": true
}'
```

### Changing signing key name

Notice that you can also provide a name to the signing key upon creation. Just provide the same `"name"` field on the creation API.

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "My new name for signing key"
}'
```

### Updating all fields

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "disabled": true,
    "name": "My new name for signing key"
}'
```

## Response

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `signing key` was successfully updated.
