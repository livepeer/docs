# Delete Stream

`DELETE /stream/{id}` deletes an existing `stream` object.

This will also suspend any active stream sessions, so make sure to wait until
the stream has finished. To explicitly interrupt an active session, consider
instead updating the `suspended` field in the `stream` using the
[`PATCH stream` API](/reference/api/update-stream).

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```
