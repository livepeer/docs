# Create Asset via URL

Import a video `Asset` from an external URL through the
`POST /api/asset/import` API.

Note: For IPFS HTTP gateway URLs, the API currently only supports “path style” URLs and does not support “subdomain style” URLs. The API will support both styles of URLs in a future update.

## Request

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/import' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "url":"$EXTERNAL_URL",
    "name":"Example name"
}'

```

## Response

## How do I upload a livestream into my assets?

Livestream recordings are automatically uploaded as `Asset`
objects. All you need to do is enable recording on your streams.

When the stream session ends, the platform waits `6min` to give a chance for the
user to reconnect on the same recording session. After that delay, the recording
is processed and you should have a new asset in your account which you can
retrieve from the list assets API.
