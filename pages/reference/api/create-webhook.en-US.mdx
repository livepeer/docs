# Create webhook

To create a new webhook, you need to make an API call with the events you want to listen for and the URL that will be called when those events occur.

### Request

```bash
curl \
    --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/webhook' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data-raw '{
      "events": ["event_name_1", "event_name_2"],
      "url": "{webhook_url}",
      "name": "Webhook name"
  }' \
  https://livepeer.studio/api/webhook
```

### Response example
