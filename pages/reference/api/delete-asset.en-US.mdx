# `DELETE` asset

`DELETE /asset/{ASSET_ID}` deletes an existing `asset` object.

This will delete an existing asset from the Livepeer API database. Keep in mind that this does not delete the contents of the asset from the storage. This means that deleted assets can still be accessed through their download and playback URLs.

> **NOTE:** If you wish for the asset to be completely removed from our storage,
> please contact us at [contact@livepeer.org](mailto:contact@livepeer.org)

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{ASSET_ID}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```
