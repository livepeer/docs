# Delete Asset

`DELETE /asset/{ASSET_ID}` deletes an existing `asset` object.

This will archive an existing asset. This means that deleted assets can still be accessed through their download and playback URLs.

> **NOTE:** If you wish for the asset to be completely removed from our storage,
> please contact us at [contact@livepeer.org](mailto:contact@livepeer.org)

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{ASSET_ID}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```
