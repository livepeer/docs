title: POST Create stream
---

# `POST` Create a stream

`POST /stream` creates a `stream` object. The configuration on this parent
`stream` object is inherited by all future child `session` objects.

The only parameter you are required to set is the `name` of your stream, but we
also highly recommend that you define the `profiles` parameter with 720p, 480p
and 360p renditions.

If you do not define transcoding rendition `profiles` when creating the
`stream`, no transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the
attributes of the source stream only, will not take advantage of adaptive
bitrate streaming and will likely buffer.

The playback policy is set to `public` by default for new streams. It can also be added upon the creation of a new stream by adding `"playbackPolicy": {"type": "jwt"}`

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
  "playbackPolicy": {"type": "jwt"}
}' \
