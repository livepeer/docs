title: POST Create stream
---

# `POST` Create a stream

`POST /stream` creates a `stream` object. The configuration on this parent
`stream` object is inherited by all future child `session` objects.

It is important to note, that the stream object is the core building block of the Livepeer Studio platform.
In Livepeer Studio, the stream object has unique configuration data and metadata about all livestream sessions that are associated with the stream.


>Note: historically, a stream object with a parentIdrepresented a single livestream session. This type of "child-session" stream object will be deprecated in an upcoming version of the API in favor of the session object.


The only parameter you are required to set is the `name` of your stream, but we
also highly recommend that you define the `profiles` parameter with 720p, 480p
and 360p renditions.

If you do not define transcoding rendition `profiles` when creating the
`stream`, no transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the
attributes of the source stream only, will not take advantage of adaptive
bitrate streaming and will likely buffer.

The playback policy is set to `public` by default for new streams. It can also be added upon the creation of a new stream by adding `"playbackPolicy": {"type": "jwt"}`

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
  "playbackPolicy": {"type": "jwt"}
}' \
