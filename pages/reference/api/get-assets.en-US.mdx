# Retrieve Assets

To list all assets in your account call `GET /api/asset`:

```jsx
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN'
```

# Retrieve an Asset

Retrieves the details of an `Asset` that has previously been imported or
uploaded. Supply the unique `Asset` ID that was returned from your previous
request, and Livepeer will return the corresponding `Asset` information.

```jsx
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/$ASSET_ID' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN'
```
