# `PATCH` Update stream

`PATCH /stream/{id}` can be used to modify a `stream` object. It is a single
endpoint that can update any of the mutable properties of a stream.
Specifically:

- `record`
- `suspended`
- `multistream.targets`

All fields in the request payload are optional, and any field that is not
included will keep the same value as before in the saved object.

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `stream` was successfully
updated.

## Turn recording on

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{ "record": true }'
```

## Suspend stream

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{ "suspended": true }'
```

## Edit Multistream Targets

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
     "multistream": {
        "targets":  [
          { "id" :"0bf161f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a", "profile": "source" },
          { "id" :"95bd0bf1-61f3-a7b1-4971-39e78a4dcb5d", "profile": "720p", "videoOnly": true }
        ]
      }
    }'
```

## Update all fields

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
     "record": false,
     "suspended": false,
     "multistream": {
        "targets":  []
      }
    }'
```

## Update Access Control Policy

A `playbackPolicy` `type` can be either:

- public - No access control is applied to the stream
- jwt - A JWT is required to playback the stream

If you set your stream playback policy to JWT, you will need to sign a token with a signing key
and put it in the playback URL to be able to playback your stream.

### Request

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d {
    "playbackPolicy": {
      "type":"jwt"
    }
  }
```

### Response

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `stream` was successfully updated.
