# Patch Recording Toggle

`PATCH /stream/{id}/record` can only modify a `stream` object. You cannot modify
the `record` value on a `session` object or the historic `stream` objects with a
`parentId` (stream objects representing a single live stream session).

The record value is inherited by all future child `session` objects. Child
session objects are read-only.

### Turn recording on

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":true}'
```

### Turn recording off

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":false}'
```

A `204` no content success status response indicates the `record` value was
updated.
