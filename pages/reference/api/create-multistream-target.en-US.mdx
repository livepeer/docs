title: POST multistream target

# `POST` multistream target

`POST /multistream/target` creates a `multistream target` object.

## Parameters

**Required**

- The only parameter you are required to set is the `url` of your target.

- The `name` will be derived from the `url` host, if not specified.

> multistreaming. You also need to reference the target from the `stream` that
> you want to streamed.

You can also refer to the [Multistreams](/guides/live/multistream) guide for
more information.
