# `PATCH` Update asset

`PATCH /asset/:id -d { }` can be used to modify any `asset` that was uploaded
with On Demand. It is a single endpoint that can update only the following
mutable properties of an asset:

- `name`
- `storage`

## Update Asset Name

This will change the name of the stored asset.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d { "name": "New name" }
```

## Updating Storage

This allows to add additional storage location of where the assets are to be
stored.

> **NOTE:**

- Currently assets cannot be deleted from storage.
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storage at the moment. We are
  currently working on support for other decentralized storages like Arweave and
  Storj.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {"storage": {"ipfs": {}}}
```

### Response

Storing a file on IPFS is a long-running operation, which can take a few seconds
to complete. As such, you won't get an immediate result on the response, but
should check the `storage.status` object of the asset (e.g. polling) until it
phases to `ready`. Then you will have the corresponding CIDs of the asset inside
the `storage.ipfs` object.

You can also use the `asset.updated` webhook to get notified when the asset
changes, both for the intermediate progress updates and the final update with
the CIDs added to the object.

## Setting NFT Metadata

When you save a file to IPFS the file's metadata can be used to mint NFTs from the video. This way you don't need to have a
separate IPFS provider only for storing your NFT metadata.

Since each marketplace has their own standard for the `metadata` of the NFT, it
is up to you to determine which standard to use and fields to include.

> **NOTE:**

- A couple of fields are included by default which are deep merged
  with the provided NFT metadata, with the provided values having precedence.

```json
    "name": , // Populated with the same name of the asset in the API
    "description": , // A default description referring to the above asset name
    "image": // A default image including the Livepeer logo as a thumbnail
    "animation_url": // IPFS URL for an immutable version of the lvpr.tv player with the video
    "external_url": // Mutable URL for the lvpr.tv player with the video
    "properties": {
      "video": // CID of the original video file saved on IPFS
      "com.livepeer.playbackId": // playback ID of the asset
    }
```

> **NOTICE** that you can change the value or delete any of these default fields
> by providing a value for it in the `nftMetadata` object, which have precedence
> over whatever is set by default. You can delete any of the above fields by
> specifying them as `null` in your overrides.

Example: `"animation_url": null`

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
      "storage": {
        "ipfs": {
          "spec": {
            "nftMetadata": {
              "title": "My awesome video",
              "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
              "tags": "awesome,life,video"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }'
```

### Response

Same as before, saving the NFT metadata on IPFS will be a long-running
operation. You can track the progress the same way as the simple IPFS request,
with the NFT metadata CID showing up in the `storage.ipfs.nftMetadata` object.

## Updating Multiple parameters

You can also specify multiple fields to update in a single `PATCH` request.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {
  "name": "New name",
  "storage": {"ipfs": {}}
  }
```

### Response

Returns a `200 OK` response with an object containing the updated properties
indicates that the `asset` was successfully updated.
