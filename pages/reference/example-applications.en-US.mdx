# Examples Applications

There are a number of projects that extend or build on Livepeer, created by our team and the community.
Here's a few examples of the projects we think are the most interesting.

| Example                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [Justcast.it](https://github.com/victorges/justcast.it)                        | This web app provides code for adding "1-click starting a livestream" so that you can create a stream using the Livepeer API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [WebRTMP](https://github.com/livepeer/webrtmp-sdk)                             | Designed for Livepeer Studio, instructions are included for using a JavaScript SDK for streaming media via RTMP from the Web. This can also be implemented for any service running a [webrtmp-server](https://github.com/livepeer/webrtmp-sdk).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Livepeer Web API Proxy](https://github.com/victorges/livepeer-web-api-proxy)  | This Proxy extends the ability to limit access to the Livepeer API for the web so that you can implement your own authentication method (e.g., if security or billing are of concern). You will be able to allow for creating streams directly from the browser without exposing access to an entire account via your API key. You can maintain, i.e. iterate and update, on the live deployment leveraging [fly.io](https://fly.io/) features. |
| [Livepeer API Usage Examples](https://github.com/livepeer/studio-sample-app)   | This example demonstrates how to add live or on demand video experiences to your application using the Livepeer API and [Livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [React Native Example](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-react-native) | This example application demonstrates how to add live video experiences to a React Native application using the Livepeer API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
