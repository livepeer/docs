# Go Livepeer CLI Reference

The `livepeer` binary in `go-livepeer` has a number of configurable options. You can
[set your configuration using command-line flags, environment variables, or a config file](/installation/configuring-livepeer).

A comprehensive list of options can be found below. They are sourced and
regularly updated from
[this file](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/cmd/livepeer/livepeer.go).
The
[go-livepeer developer docs](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/master/doc)
also contain instructions for using flags to enable certain functionality in
`livepeer`.

# Options

### Configuration

```
config: Path to config file.
```

### Network and Addresses

```
network: Network to connect to. Default `offchain`

rtmpAddr: Address to bind for RTMP commands. Default `127.0.0.1:+RtmpPort`

cliAddr: Address to bind for  CLI commands. Default `127.0.0.1:+CliPort`

httpAddr: Address to bind for HTTP commands. No default

serviceAddr: Orchestrator only. Overrides the on-chain serviceURI that broadcasters can use to contact this node; may be an IP or hostname. No default

orchAddr: Orchestrator to connect to as a standalone transcoder. No default.

verifierURL: URL of the verifier to use. No default.

verifierPath: Path to verifier shared volume. No default.

localVerify: Set to true to enable local verification i.e. pixel count and signature verification. Default `true`. However, if you are running in offchain mode, this will be set to false.

httpIngest: Set to true to enable HTTP ingest. Default `true`. However, if (1) you do not provide a value, (2) you provide a non-local URL for `httpAddr`, and (3) you do not provide an `authWebhookURL`, this will be set to false.
```

### Transcoding

```
orchestrator: Set to true to be an orchestrator. Default `false`

transcoder: Set to true to be an transcoder. Default `false`

broadcaster: Set to true to be an broadcaster. Default `false`

orchSecret: Shared secret with the orchestrator as a standalone transcoder or path to file

transcodingOptions: Transcoding options for broadcast job, or path to json config. Default `P240p30fps16x9,P360p30fps16x9`

maxAttempts: Maximum transcode attempts. Default `3`

selectRandFreq: Frequency to randomly select unknown orchestrators (on-chain mode only). Default `0.3`

maxSessions: Maximum number of concurrent transcoding sessions for Orchestrator, maximum number or RTMP streams for Broadcaster, or maximum capacity for transcoder. Default `10`

currentManifest: Expose the currently active ManifestID as \"/stream/current.m3u8\". Default `false`

nvidia: Comma-separated list of Nvidia GPU device IDs (or \"all\" for all available devices). No default

testTranscoder: Test Nvidia GPU transcoding at startup. Default `true`

sceneClassificationModelPath: Path to scene classification model. No default
```

### Onchain

```
ethAcctAddr: Existing Eth account address. For use when multiple ETH accounts exist in the keystore directory

ethPassword: Password for existing Eth account address or path to file

ethKeystorePath: Path to ETH keystore directory or keyfile. If keyfile, overrides -ethAcctAddr and uses parent directory

ethOrchAddr: address of an on-chain registered orchestrator. No default

ethUrl: EVM-compatible chain node JSON-RPC URL. No default

txTimeout: Amount of time (ms) to wait for a transaction to confirm before timing out. Default `300000 (5 mins)`

maxTxReplacements: Number of times to automatically replace pending transactions. Default `1`

gasLimit: Gas limit for ETH transaction. Default `0`

minGasPrice: Minimum gas price (priority fee + base fee) for ETH transactions in wei, 10 Gwei = 10000000000. If not set, this will be the network's default min gas fee.

maxGasPrice: Maximum gas price (priority fee + base fee) for ETH transactions in wei, 40 Gwei = 40000000000. Default `0`

ethController: Protocol smart contract address. No default

initializeRound: Set to true if running as a transcoder and the node should automatically initialize new rounds. Default false.

ticketEV: The expected value for PM tickets. Default `1000000000000`

maxTicketEV: The maximum acceptable expected value for PM tickets. Default `3000000000000`

depositMultiplier: The deposit multiplier used to determine max acceptable faceValue for PM tickets. Default `1`

pricePerUnit: The price per 'pixelsPerUnit' amount pixels. Must be greater than 0. Error if not set.

maxPricePerUnit: The maximum transcoding price (in wei) per 'pixelsPerUnit' a broadcaster is willing to accept. If not set explicitly, broadcaster is willing to accept ANY price. Default `0`

pixelsPerUnit: Amount of pixels per unit. Set to '> 1' to have smaller price granularity than 1 wei / pixel. Default `1`

pricePerBroadcaster: json list of price per broadcaster or path to json config file. Example: {"broadcasters":[{"ethaddress":"address1","priceperunit":1000,"pixelsperunit":1},{"ethaddress":"address2","priceperunit":1200,"pixelsperunit":1}]}

autoAdjustPrice: Enable/disable automatic price adjustments based on the overhead for redeeming tickets. Default `true`

blockPollingInterval: Interval in seconds at which different blockchain event services poll for blocks. Default `5`

redeemer: Set to true to run a ticket redemption service. Default `false`

redeemerAddr: URL of the ticket redemption service to use. No default

reward: Set to true to run a reward service. If you do not want to automatically call `reward()`, you need to explicitly set this to `false` for any node that's registered onchain. Otherwise, it will default to true.

monitor: Set to true to send performance metrics. Default `false`

version: Print out the version. Default `false`

v: Log verbosity -  {4|5|6}. No default

metadataQueueUri: URI for message broker to send operation metadata. No default

metadataAmqpExchange: Name of AMQP exchange to send operation metadata. Default `lp_golivepeer_metadata`

```

### Storage

```

```

### API

```
